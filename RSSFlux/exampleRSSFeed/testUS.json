Based on the stories by Andrzej Sapkowski and propelled by the overwhelming popularity of CD Projekt RED\u2019s video games,<em>\u00a0The Witcher</em>\u00a0premiered in December 2019. Season 2 had been in the works since <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-henry-cavill-geralt-coin-toss-song-warning/\">before <em>The Witcher</em> season 1 even premiered</a> and, after facing numerous delays, was finally released on Netflix on December 17, 2021. Where season 1 streamlines many of the stories in books \"The Last Wish\"\u00a0and \"Sword of Destiny\"\u00a0to introduce Geralt (Henry Cavill), Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), and Ciri (Freya Allan), <em>The Witcher</em> season 2 looks to \"Blood of Elves\"<em>\u00a0</em>for inspiration.</p><p><em>The Witcher</em>\u00a0season 2 sees Geralt and Ciri travel to Kaer Morhen and meet Witchers led by Geralt\u2019s mentor, Vesemir (Kim Bodnia). Throughout the season, it\u2019s revealed that Ciri has Elder blood, connecting her to an Elven prophecy foretelling the end of the world. Outside of that,\u00a0<em>The Witcher\u00a0</em>season 2 makes a lot of changes to its source material, including (but not limited to) <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-season-2-ciri-geralt-eskel-deidre-plot-twist-sabotage/\">Eskel\u2019s death, Yennefer's storyline</a>,\u00a0<em>that\u00a0</em>White Flame reveal, Voleth Meir, and the introduction of the Wild Hunt. Although season 2 only just became available last month, viewership has been high, and Netflix is reportedly already making plans to begin production on <em>The Witcher</em> season 3.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-season-2-love-triangle-triss-eskel-killed/\">Why Witcher Season 2 Killed Its Best Love Triangle Solution</a></span></p><p>According to\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://redanianintelligence.com/2022/01/06/the-witcher-season-3-to-start-filming-in-march-2022/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Redanian Intelligence</a></em>, pre-production for <em>The Witcher</em> season 3 is set to start this month and filming will begin in March. Before season 2 premiered, it was revealed that the scripts for season 3 had already been written. While this reported timetable is subject to change, audiences should nevertheless receive season 3 quicker than they did season 2.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Witcher-Geralt-Ciri-Yennefer.jpg\" /></figure><p>While critical reception for<em>\u00a0The Witcher</em>\u00a0season 2 has been strong, the show\u2019s audience rating on sites like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic has been much weaker than the season that preceded it. This is due in large part to fans of the books and games being upset with how far the series has <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-season-2-nivellen-story-change-books-better/\">strayed from its <em>Witcher</em>\u00a0novels source material</a>. At this point, avid readers and video game players are arguing\u00a0<em>The Witcher</em>\u00a0is less of an adaptation and more fan fiction. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if this sort of audience reaction affects production on season 3. If reports are to be believed, its timetable was put in place before the premiere of season 2.</p><p><em>The Witcher </em>season 2\u00a0ends with its three main characters together at Kaer Morhen following a fairly close encounter with the Wild Hunt on another sphere. Season 3 will begin to adapt \"Time of Contempt\"\u00a0and see Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri deal with the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, Nilfgaard, and the Elves, who all want Ciri for different purposes. This year, the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/the-witcher-prequel-series-isnt-what-you-think-theory-explained/\">prequel series <em>The Witcher: Blood Origin</em></a>, set 1200 years before the events of the flagship series, will feature many revelations about the creation of the first Witcher, the \u201cConjunction of the Spheres,\u201d and the Wild Hunt \u2014 which will likely play heavily into\u00a0<strong><em>The Witcher\u00a0</em></strong>season 3.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">More: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-wild-hunt-horsemen-story-books-games-ciri/\">Who Are The Wild Hunt?

Creep Clusters have a reddish-brown and twisted root-like appearance, and they can be found in various locations throughout the game. While all Creep Clusters serve the same functions, the Creep Clusters found on\u00a0Solstheim\u00a0have a yellow appearance instead of the usual reddish-brown, but they will still look the same in the player's inventory.</p><p>In addition to finding Creep Clusters in the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/immersive-open-world-games-like-skyrim-gta-rdr2/\">wild in <em>Skyrim</em></a>, players can plant them in their own garden or greenhouse.\u00a0When planted in a garden, Creep Clusters\u00a0can be difficult to harvest. Players should crouch down and aim slightly above the soil to pluck them. Additionally, players may have to try to harvest them from different angles as the prompt to harvest does not appear as readily for Creep Clusters as it does for other plants in the garden.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/skyrim-boethiahs-calling-sacrifice-choice-guide/\">Skyrim Boethiah's Calling: Who Should Be Sacrificed</a></span></p><p>Once harvested, Creep Clusters can be used for various\u00a0effects, including\u00a0Restore\u00a0Magicka,\u00a0Damage Stamina Regen,\u00a0Fortify Carry Weight, and\u00a0Weakness to Magic. While Restore Magicka spells will replenish the Dragonborn's magic, Damage Stamina Regen will damage its target's stamina regeneration. Fortify Carry Weight will increase the maximum amount of weight its target can carry, and Weakness to Magic will increase its\u00a0vulnerability to magic. The ideal ingredient matches for <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/skyrim-make-fortify-smithing-blacksmith-potion-guide/\">making potions in <em>Skyrim</em></a> with Creep Clusters are Dwarven Oil, Giant's Toe, Scaly Pholiota, and Taproot.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Elder-Scrolls-Skyrim-Windhelm.jpg\" /></figure><p>Players seeking Creep Clusters should start in the volcanic region to the South of\u00a0Windhelm, where the ingredient is the most abundant. Players should look for the root to be growing on or near rocks. Specifically, players may have luck finding Creep Clusters near the road heading South from\u00a0Windhelm and around the\u00a0Riverside Shack. Some may be found scattered across the ground near\u00a0Kynesgrove, to the\u00a0South of Windhelm. Creep Clusters have also been spotted\u00a0South of\u00a0Bonestrewn Crest\u00a0in the wet areas and around\u00a0the Atronach <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/skyrim-every-stone-barenziah-location-no-unturned-guide/\">Stone in <em>Skyrim</em></a>. The final location in this volcanic region to\u00a0find\u00a0Creep Clusters is just\u00a0East of the\u00a0Steamcrag Camp.</p><p>Outside of the volcanic region of Windhelm, players may find Creep Clusters in the wild of\u00a0Solstheim, particularly in the ashen areas. In addition, a single Creep Cluster is located\u00a0in\u00a0Arcadia's Cauldron\u00a0in\u00a0Whiterun. This is most likely the first harvestable Creep Cluster players will find in the game. Additionally, a single Creep Cluster can be spotted\u00a0on a desk in\u00a0Wuunferth's Quarters in the\u00a0Palace of the Kings, upstairs in Windhelm. Finally, players may find them in the\u00a0Arch-Mage's Quarters\u00a0in the\u00a0College of Winterhold.</p><p>Of note, while Creep Clusters are useful ingredients that only grow in some areas, each individual cluster only has a value of one gold. Accordingly, if players have an abundance of them, they should use them in potions to increase their <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/skyrim-pros-cons-leveling-alchemy-skill-tree/\">Alchemy skill in <em>Skyrim</em></a>. However, because of their low value,\u00a0players likely will not want to sell Creep Clusters on their own.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"http://Skyrim: How To Unlock The Spellbreaker Shield\">Skyrim: How To Unlock The Spellbreaker Shield</a></span></p><p><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition\u00a0</em></strong>is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 10:53:06 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 10, 53, 6, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/skyrim-harvest-creep-clusters-guide/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Minecraft: Best Ways to Find Ancient Debris in 1.18 | Screen Rant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Minecraft: Best Ways to Find Ancient Debris in 1.18 | Screen Rant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/minecraft-best-ways-find-ancient-debris-guide/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/minecraft-best-ways-find-ancient-debris-guide/", "authors": [{"name": "Jacob Tawil"}], "author": "Jacob Tawil", "author_detail": {"name": "Jacob Tawil"}, "tags": [{"term": "Game Guides", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "The Caves and Cliffs update for Minecraft has changed the way we know mining forever.

While the first part of the Caves and Cliffs update served as a prelude to what was to come, the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-caves-cliffs-part-2-biome-changes/\">second part of the update</a> has changed the overworld and underworld forever. New biomes have been added, caves are larger than ever before, and 91 new blocks have been added to the game. Since the Caves and Cliffs update\u00a0changed the way blocks are loaded into the world, many previous traditional strategies, like strip mining for diamonds, are no longer the most efficient way to find the ore players may be looking for. This update has also changed the way players should be looking for Ancient Debris.</p><p>The second part of the Caves and Cliffs update has made diamonds much easier to find when exploring deep underground. There's a new <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-diamond-level-mining-guide/\">best level to find diamonds in\u00a0<em>Minecraft</em></a>, but the update has made it so diamonds can spawn anywhere under Y-level 0, including the game's new cave biomes. With diamonds being easier to find, the incentive to dive into the new Nether and grind for Ancient Debris to make Netherite has never been higher. Players are going to need a diamond pickaxe to mine Ancient Debris. They will also want a complete set of diamond armor to protect them from harsh Nether terrain and mobs.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-find-goat-horns-farming-guide/\">Minecraft: How to Find Goat Horns (&amp; What They're For)</a></span></p><p>Netherite is one of the best resources in\u00a0<em>Minecraft; it</em>\u00a0is stronger than diamonds, has a higher blast resistance, and is resistant to fire, meaning the gear can't even burn in lava if dropped in it. Four Ancient Debris are needed to create the materials to make a Netherite Ingot. One Netherite Ingot can be used to upgrade and piece of diamond armor or tool at a smithing table. Unfortunately, even though last year's <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-nether-update-launch-release-changes-mobs-biomes/\">Nether update made the\u00a0underworld more accessible</a>, Ancient Debris is still difficult and dangerous to mine.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Minecraft-Acient-Debris-Uses-Location.jpg\" /></figure><p>Ancient Debris is most often found on Y-level -14 in the Neth r. They usually spawn at the edge of loaded chunks in the Nether, so players can use two different methods to find the most Ancient Debris possible. Ancient Debris is the rarest block in the game and rarely spawn in veins of more than 1, so be patient while setting out to mine them.</p><p>Players looking to get Ancient Debris earlier in their survival world and maybe lacking the tools necessary to strip mine will want to craft a lot of beds.\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/kill-ender-dragon-beds-minecraft/\">Beds explode in the End</a> and Nether, which destroys all the weak blocks around it and clears out a large chunk of blocks underground d. All players have to do is place a bed four blocks away from them, use one block of cobblestone under their feet to protect them from the glass, and interact with the bed to make it blow up, keeping the player out of harm's w y. While this method is slower than strip mining, the bed method is still the most efficient way to mine Ancient Debris in the early game.</p><p>Players stacked up with plenty of enchanted pickaxes will probably find it easier to strip mine for their Ancient Debris in the late game. However, it's not as simple as strip mining for <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-update-best-places-mine-diamonds-guide/\">diamonds used to be before <em>Minecraft </em>1. 8</a>. Players will once again want to head down to the Y-level -14 in the Nether, then begin mining away with their multiple pickaxes. Ancient Debris spawns much more often on the edge of loaded chunks, meaning players on\u00a0<em>Minecraft\u00a0</em>Java Edition<em>\u00a0</em>can use hotkeys to see where chunks are loaded in and mine constantly on the edge of them. Sadly, players on Bedrock Edition cannot do this, so their strip mining experience will be left more up to chance. Depending on players' luck, this method can be far better or worse than the bed method, especially in the late game.</p><p>Finding <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-ancient-debris-netherite-nether-materials-where/\">Ancient Debris for Netherite in\u00a0<em>Minecraft's</em>\u00a0Nether</a>\u00a0is likely the longest grind players will have to go through if they want their armor and tools to be the strongest they can be. Players will want to be careful, as they'll be running into a lot of lava and terrain that could cause careless deaths. Mining Ancient Debris is no easy task, but players should be able to find Ancient Debris at a decent rate using these methods.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-player-creeper-head-lettuce-farm-build/\">Minecraft Player Uses Creeper Heads In Farm as Heads of Lettuce</a></span></p><p><strong><em>Minecraft</em></strong>\u00a0is available on PC, Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 10:21:22 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 10, 21, 22, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/minecraft-best-ways-find-ancient-debris-guide/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Game Of Thrones: 15 Best Arya Stark Quotes | Screen Rant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Game Of Thrones: 15 Best Arya Stark Quotes | Screen Rant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/game-of-thrones-arya-stark-best-quotes/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/game-of-thrones-arya-stark-best-quotes/", "authors": [{"name": "Stephen Lagioia"}], "author": "Stephen Lagioia", "author_detail": {"name": "Stephen Lagioia"}, "tags": [{"term": "Lists", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Games of Thrones in general has some great lines, but Arya Stark&#039;s best quotes, in particular, are chilling and intimidating to hear.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Games of Thrones in general has some great lines, but Arya Stark&#039;s best quotes, in particular, are chilling and intimidating to hear."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/game-of-thrones/\"><i>Game of Thrones</i></a><i>\u00a0</i>is brimming with characters that are just as rich and interesting as the historically-inspired fantasy worlds they reside in.

Frankly, even Cersei would be impressed by the swiftness with which Arya manages to dispatch her enemies.</p><p>And even though Arya ultimately chose life over death, she at least got to live out her revenge fantasies for a little while before confronting her philosophical and moral crisis.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/0.lordsnow.jpg\" /></figure><p>In much the same way that the Stark girl quotes\u00a0lines spoken by her family, she also shows her inspiration and devotion to\u00a0Syrio Forel\u00a0by speaking this line, a variant of\u00a0<em>\"every hurt is a lesson, and every lesson makes us better.\"\u00a0</em></p><p>The bruise analogy certainly fits Arya's dark, tragic history, along with her philosophy of overcoming hardships and becoming stronger through adversity. Arya definitely learned through trials by fire, and it made her into one of the most powerful characters in the series.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Night-King-Arya-Stark.jpg\" /></figure><p>While Arya has little exposure to the White Walkers, even by the opening of the final season, she makes it clear to Gendry that she's not exactly phased by an army of the undead. She's had close encounters with death, violence, and has\u00a0herself\u00a0slain many at this point, so what's to fear about some ice zombies?</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/arya-stark-journey-game-thrones/\">Arya Stark's Journey Throughout Game Of Thrones</a></span></p><p>This is a clever quote that reinforces Arya's strength, though it also serves as some foreshadowing for the otherwise surprising ending to \"The Long Night\" episode of season 8. In it, Arya leaps from the shadows and takes out the Night King, catching him off guard as he zeroes in on Bran. It seems her embracing of death has turned her into quite the effective assassin, even managing to kill a manifestation of death\u00a0itself.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Maisie-Williams-as-Arya-Stark-and-Tom-Wlaschiha-as-Jaqen-H---Ghar-in-Game-of-Thrones-Season-6-Episode-5.jpg\" /></figure><p>Arya learns the mantra of \"wiping the slate clean\" and existing as \"no one\"\u00a0when being initiated into the Faceless Men. This philosophical food for thought is certainly a representation of her character and place in the world during the middle of\u00a0<em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>Stripped of just about everything and everyone she loves, Arya faces little choice but to lose her own identity. After being trained and occasionally put through the wringer by Jaqen H'ghar and other Faceless Men,\u00a0she's\u00a0is finally able to claim to be \"no one\" with sincerity. It's this training in stealth, evasion, and emotional disassociation that allows her to develop further as a character and accomplish her goals of revenge. When asked who taught her to fight during a sparring match with Brienne, she cleverly answers,\u00a0\"no one.\"\u00a0No one, indeed.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Arya-Stark-leaves-the-Faceless-Men-in-Season-6.jpg\" /></figure><p>The Faceless Men are a group of assassins that can literally transform themselves into other people with their changing faces, and a huge part of their ethos revolves around becoming \"no one.\"</p><p>And although Arya became an excellent fighter and seemingly did her best to leave Arya Stark behind, she could never isolate herself from who she really was, and it doesn't seem like she truly wanted to. After surviving Jaqen's gauntlet, Arya reclaimed her own identity and made it her mission to return to Winterfell.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Arya-Stark-Maisie-Williams-executes-Walder-Frey-on-Game-of-Thrones.jpg\" /></figure><p>There aren't many feel-good moments in\u00a0<em>Game of Thrones\u00a0</em>that measure up to this bout of vengeance by Arya, especially after the grim events of previous seasons. After many episodes of anticipation building up to Arya's sworn revenge of Walder Frey,\u00a0fans finally see her swift plot come to fruition.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/lord-of-the-rings-vs-game-of-thrones-comparison/\">5 Things Lord Of The Rings Does Better Than Game Of Thrones (&amp; 5 Things Game Of Thrones Does Better)</a></span></p><p>This is an impactful line that displays Arya's cunning as well as her relentlessness of exacting her own brand of vigilante justice. It's a powerful moment for her character and yet another reminder that, despite her innocent appearance, Arya is not to be messed with. It also acts as a satisfying payoff of the trials and tribulations of learning the ways of the Faceless Men, as she was able to disguise herself to get to Walder, and then become Walder himself.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Game-of-Thrones-Finale-Arya-Ship.jpg\" /></figure><p>This heartfelt scene near the end of the\u00a0<em>Game of Thrones\u00a0</em>finale sees the remaining Stark children parting ways. For Arya, this means getting\u00a0far<em>\u00a0</em>away from the tragic losses and misery to which she has borne witness to. This doesn't mean Essos, but to a distant land never before alluded and apparently not known.\u00a0She's going \"west of Westeros,\" but beyond this, her destination is not revealed.</p><p>This illustrates that Arya doesn't strive for the destination, but the journey itself, as well as to \"escape\" or become liberated. Arya is set to venture on her own, like the lone wolf she is. It's a bittersweet ending for her, but one that feels fitting.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Game-of-Thrones-Season-8-Trailer-Arya-Stark.jpg\" /></figure><p>From the very start of the series, one of Arya's greatest and most valid frustrations is that her life was set out before her without her having much of a say in it. And the same can be said of almost all women in Westeros, as they have very narrow options in terms of what the world is willing to let them do.</p><p>But by the time Arya sailed westward, she had claimed the right to choose her own life regardless of what anyone else wanted.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/helen-sloan---hbo-photo-2.jpg\" /></figure><p>One of\u00a0Arya's few quotes that actually surpasses the impact of her last line to Walder is when she addresses the Frey men disguised\u00a0as<em>\u00a0</em>Walder.</p><p>While season 7 as a whole received a tepid response from fans, it started off with a bang when \"Walder Frey\"\u00a0addresses\u00a0his men discussing the slaughtering of the Red Wedding bluntly. Viewers soon discover this is not Frey, but actually <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/game-of-thrones-arya-stark-kills-ranked-least-most-brutal/\">Arya, as the men holding goblets of wine suddenly keel over and die</a>. The already powerful scene then closes out with this memorable line. It's a neat little Stark-themed\u00a0allegory\u00a0that adds the exclamation point to a pivotal scene in <em>Game of\u00a0Thrones</em>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Melisandre-and-Arya-at-the-Battle-of-Winterfell.jpg\" /></figure><p>Arya's journey throughout <em>Game of Thrones</em> was largely about her simply fighting for survival, and one of the overarching themes of her story was\u00a0clearly death versus life.</p><p>Arya was responsible for many assassinations in the series, but when it came to squaring off against the God of Death, Arya's reply was always, \"not today\". Syrio Forel started Arya on her path towards becoming a warrior, but little did he know that his wise words may have helped her save the world.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-best-sansa-stark-quotes/\">10 Best Sansa Stark Quotes In Game Of Thrones</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 12:51:12 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 12, 51, 12, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/game-of-thrones-arya-stark-best-quotes/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Skyrim: How to Get Shadowmere | Screen Rant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Skyrim: How to Get Shadowmere | Screen Rant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/skyrim-get-shadowmere-horse-mount-guide/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/skyrim-get-shadowmere-horse-mount-guide/", "authors": [{"name": "Ethan Webb"}], "author": "Ethan Webb", "author_detail": {"name": "Ethan Webb"}, "tags": [{"term": "Game Guides", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Shadowmere is one of the beloved horses of the Elder Scrolls series, and players can obtain this Mount in Skyrim by joining the Dark Brotherhood.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Shadowmere is one of the beloved horses of the Elder Scrolls series, and players can obtain this Mount in Skyrim by joining the Dark Brotherhood."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Skyrim-How-to-Get-Shadowmere.jpg\" /></figure><p>Shadowmere, once the loyal horse of the Lucien Lachance, is an obtainable Mount in\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/skyrim/\"><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></strong></a>\u00a0for the Dragonborn.

The latter movie saw the character fall into the awaiting mouth of the sarlacc sand beast.</p><p>Morrison first took on the role of Boba Fett in\u00a0<em>The Mandalorian\u00a0</em>season 2 with his first full appearance occurring in the episode, \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy.\" Taking place five years after the events of\u00a0<em>Return of the Jedi</em>, the Disney+ series confirmed <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-sarlacc-victims-keep-alive-digest-millennium/\">Boba Fett's survival from the sarlacc's mouth</a>, retconning his apparent death. Morrison's character also plays a role in the next two episodes, helping Mando rescue the child from Moff Gideon. After creating a distraction to\u00a0aid in the rescue, Fett flies off into hyperspace, where is not seen again until a post-credits scene which sees him and his sidekick, Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen), return to Tatooine and sit on the throne that once belonged to Jabba the Hutt.\u00a0<em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> picks up after that end-credits sequence.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-ship-slave-1-missing-location-where/\">Where's Slave-1 During The Book Of Boba Fett?</a></span></p><p>Speaking with\u00a0<em>THR</em>, Morrison, along with his co-star Ming-Na Wen, tease big surprises coming in\u00a0<em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> season 1 finale. Calling the series, \"<em>full of surprises</em>,\" Morrison goes on the say they've, \"<em>got some good stuff coming up</em>.\" Wen reportedly had to stop Morrison before he gave away too much; however, the actor does say, \"<em>wait till episode seven, wow!</em>\"\u00a0See Morrison's full quote below:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYes, full of surprises.

This is particularly due to the show's use of several flashbacks that don't entirely focus on the storyline fans have been anticipating. Although these flashbacks are setting the scene, so to speak, they aren't exactly connecting with every viewer. Nonetheless, the show's creators have also hinted at surprises yet to come, which may help to keep fans coming back for more.</p><p>Fresh off the heels of Luke Skywalker's surprising appearance in\u00a0<em>The Mandalorian</em> season 2 finale,\u00a0audiences are waiting for <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/boba-fett-darth-maul-crimson-dawn-connection-explained/\">big surprises in\u00a0<em><strong>The Book of Boba Fett</strong></em></a>. Morrison specifically mentions the show's finale, episode seven, as being particularly noteworthy. Hopefully, the surprises yet to be seen are enough to keep\u00a0people interested, otherwise they may not be willing to watch a second season.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-wars-boba-fett-solo-pyke-syndicate-explained/\">Book Of Boba Fett's Train Gang Has A Big Han Solo Connection</a></span></p><p>Source: THR</p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 05:33:01 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 5, 33, 1, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-temuera-morrison-finale-surprise-response/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus Trailer Confirms Shops & Player Customization", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus Trailer Confirms Shops & Player Customization"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-shop-customization-hisui/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-shop-customization-hisui/", "authors": [{"name": "Laura Gray"}], "author": "Laura Gray", "author_detail": {"name": "Laura Gray"}, "tags": [{"term": "Game News", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus has a new six-minute trailer showcasing gameplay for the Pok\u00e9dex, character customization, and shops as well as big map views.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus has a new six-minute trailer showcasing gameplay for the Pok\u00e9dex, character customization, and shops as well as big map views."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pok--mon-Legends-Arceus-HD-Trailer-Reveals-Gameplay.jpg\" /></figure><p>A new Japanese trailer has been released for\u00a0<strong><em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/pokemon-legends-arceus/\">Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus</a></em></strong>, offering a more detailed glimpse into the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-not-open-world-gameplay-how/\">upcoming Hisui region's mechanics</a>. Much of the detail surrounding\u00a0<em>Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus</em> has remained vague since the game was announced last year, leaving fans to speculate what could be expected of the groundbreaking new addition to the\u00a0<em>Pok\u00e9mon</em> series. However, with the release date only a few weeks away, more information is being revealed, giving fans plenty to get excited about.</p><p><em>Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus</em> will take players on a very different Pok\u00e9mon journey than previous main series games. The modern settings and techy gadgets of titles like\u00a0<em>Sword and Shield</em> have been traded for a historic journey into the past of Generation Four's Sinnoh region. Players will have a chance to help build the first Pok\u00e9dex, throw proto-type Pok\u00e9 Balls, and travel the Hisui region's unsettled landscapes in search of Pok\u00e9mon species. While the official Pok\u00e9dex lineup hasn't been revealed, a few species like Rowlet, the Grass-type starter from Alola, point to a <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/new-pokemon-legends-arceus-catch/\">wider inclusion of\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon</a> than was seen in\u00a0<em>Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</em>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a class=\"bc-title-link\" href=\"https://screenrant.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-catchable-mythical-special-event/\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus Risks Ruining What Made Arceus So Special\">Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus Risks Ruining What Made Arceus So Special</a></span></p><p>A new Japanese trailer for <em>Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus,\u00a0</em>uploaded on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=430N__0EzI8&amp;ab_channel=Nintendo%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8F%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%8D%E3%83%AB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo</a>'s YouTube channel, confirms a wide variety of exciting gameplay mechanics. The trailer details fights with powerful Pok\u00e9mon, new visuals of areas within Hisui,\u00a0and\u00a0information about the rudimentary Pok\u00e9dex. New character customization options are also showcased, with confirmation that players will be able to\u00a0change their hair and accessories, as well as outfits, with a variety of styles to pick between. It also appears there will be a variety of shops with crafting items for sale, making access to needed items less of a potential hassle.</p><p>The trailer gives a better look at what players can expect from the paper Pok\u00e9dex they will be filling. It appears that like past Pok\u00e9dex models, info will be filled in when a Pok\u00e9mon is seen as well as when they are caught. There will also be several tabs for players to toggle between, though it isn't clear what the tabs will include. It is possible that certain areas will have the potential to spawn Pok\u00e9mon from other regions after players complete certain tasks in <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/pokmon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl-national-dex-bdsp/\"><em>Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus</em>, similar to the National Pok\u00e9dex</a> unlocked in previous games. However, nothing has currently been confirmed by Nintendo.</p><p>Unfortunately, the one thing that doesn't seem to be clear in the new trailer is the function of the open-world-style maps. It has been confirmed that the Hisui region won't be a true open world, but there hasn't been an official demonstration of how the explorable areas will be accessed. Hopefully, further information will continue to release as the launch day for\u00a0<em>Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus</em>\u00a0creeps closer.

In 2012, following Sam Raimi\u2019s abandoned\u00a0<em>Spider-Man 4</em>, Garfield inherited Tobey Maguire\u2019s web-slinging mantel via Marc Webb\u2019s\u00a0<em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>. For the most part, that film satisfied fans and critics. However, the<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/amazing-spiderman-3-canceled-reason-plans/\"> lackluster reception of\u00a0</a><em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/amazing-spiderman-3-canceled-reason-plans/\">The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)</a> </em>ultimately<em>\u00a0</em>resulted in Sony/Marvel Studios\u2019 deal to reboot the character again in the MCU with Tom Holland\u2014which cut Garfield\u2019s tenure short.</p><p>Despite\u00a0Garfield\u2019s many claims to the contrary, Marvel Studios and Sony\u2019s<em>\u00a0No Way Home </em>does<em>\u00a0</em>bring back his and Maguire\u2019s Peter Parker/Spider-Men. As the follow-up to\u00a0<em>Far From Home\u00a0</em>(2019),\u00a0<em>No Way Home</em>\u00a0sees Holland\u2019s Peter seek Doctor Strange\u2019s help in making the world forget he\u2019s Spider-Man.

Thankfully, Maguire and Garfield also show up to help Holland combat their respective villains and learn a thing or two about \u201c<em>great power</em>\u201d and \u201c<em>great responsibility</em>.\u201d While the appearance of both elder Spideys has moved the fandom, the general consensus seems to be that Garfield steals the show. Now, the internet wants to see Garfield return as Spider-Man in more movies.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/amazing-spiderman-andrew-garfield-return-likely-maguire/\">Why Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man Return Is More Likely Than Tobey Maguire</a></span></p><p>For the first time since the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-box-office-us-total/\">release of\u00a0<em>No Way Home</em></a>, Garfield has opened up about his experience on the film. In an interview with\u00a0<em>Variety</em>, the actor talked about what brought him back to Spider-Man and what it meant to him to get a chance to redeem his character narratively and commercially. When asked if he\u2019d be open to coming back to the character again, Garfield said he\u2019d definitely be open to something if it felt right. Read his full quote below:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI mean, yes, definitely open to something if it felt right. Peter and Spider-Man, those characters are all about service, to the greater good and the many. He\u2019s a working-class boy from Queens that knows struggle and loss and is deeply empathetic. I would try to borrow Peter Parker\u2019s ethical framework in that, if there was an opportunity to step back in and tell more of that story, I would have to feel very sure and certain in myself.\u201d</p></blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Andrew-Garfield-Kid-Amazing-Spider-Man-2.jpg\" /></figure><p>Garfield also talked about how grateful he is to have been able to tie up loose ends for his Peter. The basis of Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, Sony Executive Amy Pascal, and director Jon Watts\u2019<em>\u00a0No Way Home</em>\u00a0pitch/initial conversation with Garfield concerned closure\u2014\"<em>If his character were dumped into the MCU and faced a younger and older version of himself, how would he respond?</em>\"\u00a0That being asked, Garfield\u2019s\u00a0<em>No Way Home\u00a0</em>arc directly connects to <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/no-way-home-garfield-spiderman-tragedy-stan-lee/\">the death of Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy</a> in\u00a0<em>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</em>. In\u00a0<em>No Way Home</em>, Garfield talks about how his inability to save Gwen still haunts him and, in the wake of that tragedy, he stopped pulling his punches as Spider-Man. In the final battle, Garfield redeems himself by saving Holland\u2019s love interest in a way he wishes he could've for Gwen.</p><p><em>No Way Home</em>\u00a0reminds audiences that Garfield was and always has been a quality Peter Parker and Spider-Man. On top of that, it does award him and his character closure. While fans want more of him via\u00a0<em>The Amazing Spider-Man 3</em>\u00a0or an appearance elsewhere in Sony\u2019s Spider-Man Universe (fighting Tom Hardy\u2019s Venom <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/morbius-movie-delay-spiderman-andrew-garfield-fans-response/\">or Jared Leto\u2019s Morbius</a>), it risks tarnishing his bookend in\u00a0<em>No Way Home</em>. Many worried his role in<strong><em>\u00a0Spider-Man: No Way Home\u00a0</em></strong>would come off as gimmicky and, while it\u2019s certainly fan service, it\u2019s the best kind. The kind that honors and legitimizes what came before.

Given how tough the finance industry can be in a major city like NYC, Sarah seems to be wise beyond her years, which could have resulted in her making a\u00a0good first impression on Clayton on night one. According to her intro interview with <a href=\"https://www.dgepress.com/abc/shows/the-bachelor/bios/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ABC</a>, Sarah loves her dogs, gets annoyed by slow walkers, and is inspired by Wonder Woman.

Bernthal is an American actor best known for his roles in <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/fear-the-walking-dead/\">The Walking Dead</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/daredevil/\">Daredevil</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-punisher/\">The Punisher</a></em>. He first gained prominence in the 2000s with his role as Shane Walsh on <em>The Walking Dead</em>. His breakthrough role came in 2016 when he portrayed <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/jon-bernthal-twitter-trend-daredevil-mcu-possible/\">The Punisher in Marvel's <em>Daredevil</em></a>, a role he would reprise\u00a0for his\u00a0solo series,\u00a0<em>The Punisher</em>, in 2017. Viewers still hold out hope that Bernthal\u00a0might yet reprise his role as The Punisher\u00a0once more in the MCU.</p><p>For now, though, Bernthal has taken on an entirely different role in the film <em>King Richard</em>. The biographical drama film, released on November 19, 2021, follows Richard Williams' unrelenting dream and efforts to make his two daughters, Venus and Serena, the world's best tennis players. Bernthal stars as a Macci, the legendary American tennis coach and player, who trained five number one ranked tennis players, including Serena and Venus. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/king-richard-movie-cast-character-real-life-comparison/\">Bernthal's role in <em>King Richard</em></a> required quite a bit of training\u00a0to do justice to Macci's tennis skills.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/king-richard-ending-explained-venus-serena-after-movie/\">King Richard Ending Explained: What Happened To Everybody After The Movie</a></span></p><p>In an interview with <em>THR</em>, Bernthal revealed that he lost 30\u00a0pounds playing tennis while training for his <em>King Richard</em> role. Bernthal admitted that he knew very little of tennis when he first landed the role. However, he held immense respect for Macci\u00a0and believed that it was very important to make a sports film accurate. To prepare for his role, he trained at an academy in Ojai for 3 hours a day, losing 30\u00a0pounds in the process. He also got the opportunity to train a real-life Junior National Player, Kamea Medora, while in character. When the pandemic shut down production, Bernthal took it as an opportunity to put six additional months into his training. Check out his statement below:</p><blockquote><p>It was such a joy for me to channel you, man. I believe in the way that you conduct your life. It was a joy for me to play such a joyous person. I played sports my whole life. I did not know much about tennis when this thing started. But I am a firm believer that if you\u2019re going to do a sports movie, you\u2019ve got to get the sport right. I find it enormously disrespectful when films don\u2019t do that. I was enormously grateful to the producers to give me the infrastructure to really learn the game of tennis. I trained at an academy out here in Ojai for three hours a day. I lost 30 pounds. I would learn the game of tennis, but then I also got to learn how to coach. I worked with a top 50 junior nationals player named Kamea Medora, who was awesome, and I trained her in character. To be able to do those drills and be able to coach in character, I felt that then stepping in, I was in a great place. The other thing is, Rick \u2014 I mean, besides the unbelievable sexiness and beauty of that mustache, and your overall thing you\u2019ve got going on \u2014 you have one of the most unique voices and dialects and speech patterns of anyone I\u2019ve ever heard. That was one thing I really wanted to get right \u2026 but the thing that I felt like I was most interested in was your heart. Your heart, loving these two young women, loving this family, wanting to be a part of this mission. And [having production] shut down for six months [during the pandemic] gave me six more months to keep on preparing, keep on playing, keep on training.</p></blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/king-richard-bomb.jpg\" /></figure><p>Bernthal wasn't the only one who had to undergo some intense training for his role in <em>King Richard</em>.\u00a0Saniyya Sidney and\u00a0Demi Singleton who portray Venus and Serena, respectively, had never played tennis before their roles. Their roles as <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/king-richard-movie-venus-serena-actresses-tennis-training/\">Serena and Venus required hours of intense training</a> to be able to accurately portray the sport. As Bernthal expresses, though, when a biographic sports film is made, it needs to be as close to the real deal as possible. Fortunately, all of the actors and actresses seem to have shown incredible work ethic in truly learning and loving the sport as their characters did. Bernthal especially attempted to embrace the heart and joy that Macci exhibited, which made him such a beloved coach.</p><p><em>King Richard</em> has received\u00a0overwhelmingly positive reception from critics since its release.\u00a0The film received praise for its overall\u00a0premise\u00a0of warmth\u00a0and emphasis on the power of determination and belief. Critics especially praised the performances of the actresses and actors across the board.\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/king-richard-movie-will-smith-oscar-best-actor/\">Will Smith particularly shined as Venus and Serena's father </a>and has prompted conversation about a potential Oscar nomination.\u00a0However, while Smith, Sidney, and Singleton certainly gave astounding performances, Bernthal's story shows that it was a combined effort from all of the cast and crew that brought the film to life. These actors and actresses seemed especially intent to accurately capture the heart and joy of the sport, using hours of their time each day to learn the ins and outs of tennis. Much of <strong><em>King Richard's</em></strong> success stems from the\u00a0cast who\u00a0put their entire hearts into their characters to do justice to the real-life figures.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"next-single\">More:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/king-richard-movie-soundtrack-songs/\">Every Song In King Richard</a></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Source: THR</p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 03:30:07 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 3, 30, 7, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/king-richard-jon-bernthal-weight-loss-training-response/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "The Bachelor: Lyndsey Windham's Age, Instagram, Job, Hometown & More", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "The Bachelor: Lyndsey Windham's Age, Instagram, Job, Hometown & More"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/bachelor-lyndsey-windham-age-instagram-career-hometown-facts/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/bachelor-lyndsey-windham-age-instagram-career-hometown-facts/", "authors": [{"name": "Bernardo Sim"}], "author": "Bernardo Sim", "author_detail": {"name": "Bernardo Sim"}, "tags": [{"term": "Reality TV", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Lyndsey Windham is vying for Clayton Echard&#039;s love on The Bachelor season 26.

As Bachelor Nation entered the new year, a bunch of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-clayton-echard-season-26-episode-1-watch-recap/\">changes were introduced to <em>The Bachelor</em></a>. For one, longtime host Chris Harrison was finally replaced with new host Jesse Palmer, who had been the lead of <em>The Bachelor</em> season 5 back in 2004.

Over the years, producers have traditionally waited for a current season to air before choosing any particular cast member to lead his or her own cycle\u00a0in the Bachelor Nation franchise. This time, though, production chose Clayton as the lead of season 26 before he had even <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-michelle-young-clayton-echard-visit-mansion-video/\">appeared\u00a0a single time on Michelle's season</a>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a class=\"bc-title-link\" href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-premiere-teddi-wright-clayton-echard-kiss-reaction/\" title=\"Bachelor: Teddi Wright Reacts To Kissing Clayton Echard On Night One\">Bachelor: Teddi Wright Reacts To Kissing Clayton Echard On Night One</a></span></p><p>Fans are now being introduced to Lyndsey Windham as she vies for Clayton's heart. Lyndsey is a 28-year-old industrial sales representative from Houston, Texas. Per <a href=\"https://www.dgepress.com/abc/shows/the-bachelor/bios/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ABC</a>, Lyndsey doesn't like clowns at all and can't sleep without hearing the sounds of some white noise. Moreover, as a fan of Spice Girls, Lyndsey considers herself more like a Baby Spice than like a Sporty Spice.\u00a0In turn, her ideal partner would be someone who is <em>\"humble, reliable, and ready to be her best friend.\"</em> Lyndsey identifies as a person of faith and feels like she's ready to stop wasting her time with the wrong men.</p><p>With over 6,000 followers on Instagram as of this writing, Lyndsey is <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-clayton-echard-season-26-cast-instagram-list/\">growing on social media since the <em>Bachelor</em> premiere</a>.

Her grid consists of a lot of pictures hanging out with her friends and living life to the fullest. It's also clear that Lyndsey enjoys spending time at the beach and traveling. In a\u00a0very funny\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CYCoPlSPmb0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> from December 28, Lyndsey shared a photo of herself on the show alongside Clayton\u00a0with the quote, <em>\"So are you Clayton or Jesse?\"</em> She was clearly joking with that caption, but a lot of viewers did point out during the season 26 premiere that Clayton and Jesse look oddly similar.</p><p>Lyndsey received a rose from Clayton during <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-premiere-why-daytime-rose-ceremony-clayton-echard/\">her first episode on <em>The Bachelor</em></a>, but it still isn't clear if she's going to make it all the way to the end.

For years, DiCaprio has worked tirelessly to bring <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/eternals-climate-change-celestial-tiamut-earth/\">the issue of climate change</a> and environmental degradation into mainstream discourse, establishing himself as one of the most outspoken celebrity environmentalists in the process. Though his work is far from over in this respect, DiCaprio has managed to highlight some major issues while continuing to be a considerable draw on the big screen.</p><p>At present, the 47-year-old Oscar-winner can be seen in the record-breaking <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/dont-look-up/\">Don\u2019t Look Up</a>,</em> which boasts a star-studded cast and has earned much acclaim since its release. And while the film deals with the subject of mass extinction in a slightly different manner than the very real issue of climate change does, DiCaprio has previously helped to deliver a variety of films such as <em>Virunga</em>, <em>Before the Flood</em>, <em>Catching the Sun</em> and <em>The Ivory Game, </em>all of which explore human responsibility for environmental destruction in one capacity or another as well as possible solutions to these problems. At times criticized for being just another celebrity flaunting their cause de jour for publicity, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/drew-barrymore-leonardo-dicaprio-flirt-instagram-comment-image/\">DiCaprio has proven himself highly aware</a> of ongoing environmental injustice, most recently speaking out in support of indigenous Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en water defenders resisting illegal encroachment of their traditional lands.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/leonardo-dicaprio-upcoming-movies-shows-roles/\">Every Upcoming Leonardo DiCaprio Movie &amp; TV Show</a></span></p><p>Whether film or environmental related, it might seem that by this point, DiCaprio has achieved about as much as one person can. However, according to <em>Variety</em>, there\u2019s still room for the <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/titanic/\">Titanic</a> </em>star to take things to the next level. Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew has honored DiCaprio by naming a rare tree found in a Cameroonian forest after him. The small tropical evergreen trees are reportedly in critical danger of being rendered extinct and have therefore been named <em>Uvariopsis dicaprio</em> in hopes of drawing attention to the logging currently take place in the Ebo Forest.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dont-look-up-randall-mindy-comet-impact.jpg\" /></figure><p>At present, logging practices within Cameroon are causing extensive environmental damage, with much of the destruction coming as the result of illegal logging. To suggest that naming an endangered tree species after a major Hollywood celebrity is going to fix that problem might be considered na\u00efve by some, but with DiCaprio\u2019s extensive fanbase and his ability to draw awareness with something as little as a social media post, the concept has its share of benefits. But, of course, beyond any debate regarding the efficacy of a DiCaprio tree is the assurance that having an actual tree named after you is a pretty cool honor.</p><p>Taking stock of continuing environmental damage and the changing climate that this devastation brings is never an easy pill to swallow.

This has led to each character having a number of quotes that have stuck out amongst the 10 seasons of the show.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/glee-characters-friends-counterparts/\">Glee Main Characters And Their Friends Counterparts</a></span></p><p>Out of all the hilarious jokes and emotional moments, some singular lines manage to shine. This can be due to how funny they are, how well they embody the character, or just how much of a gut punch they are to hear. Either way, these <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/friends/\"><em>Friends</em></a> quotes are worth discussing.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Joey-in-Friends.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Joey is one of television's most beloved flirts, and this quote epitomizes that. Viewers likely can't read the quote without picturing Joey's exact expression and hearing the quote in his voice. While the quote actually didn't appear until the fourth season, it feels like it was around for the show's whole run, for just how quintessentially Joey it is. Joey first uses the quote on Pheobe, who can't help but smile and giggle.</p><p>Throughout the other seasons, the other friends get to put their own spin on the pick-up line, such as Rachel drunkenly responding to Joey, \"I'm doin' good baby, how you doin'?\" Overall, it's a short but iconic quote.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Friends-Rachel-Ross-Finale.jpg\" /></figure><p>If there was any climactic moment of the show, this would be it. After a decade of will-they-won't-they, Ross and Rachel finally get together for good in the show's final episode. This happens after Ross asks Rachel not to take a job in Paris, right before she gets on the plane. Rachel initially turns him away, but then Ross hears over the phone that she wants to get off the plane. She suddenly appears and says that she managed to do just that.</p><p>While some fans now wonder if Rachel made the right decision, there's no denying that this is an iconic moment and the culmination of the show's longest-running relationship.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Monica-And-Rachel-Hug-Pilot-Friends-Sitcom.jpg\" /></figure><p>Adulthood is hard, and this was made apparent through the show's first episode. Rachel leaves her wedding, along with her life of wealth and privilege, to make it on her own in the real world. Initially, she doesn't fully commit, as she relies on her father's credit cards.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/glee-characters-friends-counterparts/\">Glee Main Characters &amp; Their Friends Counterparts</a></span></p><p>But after the friends make her cut them all up, Monica welcomes her to their world, a world that is filled with a lot more hardships, but one that will ultimately be more fulfilling. This quote has become the pinnacle of young adulthood, as people find out just how tough the real world can be, and every person must find a way to love it.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rachel-at-Ross-Wedding.jpg\" /></figure><p>This quote may be one of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/friends-reddit-cringeworthy-moments/\">the cringiest moments on <em>Friends</em></a>, but that's part of what makes it so memorable. By this point in the show, Ross and Rachel had technically split up twice. However, Rachel realizes that she is still in love with Ross and goes to stop his wedding. While she doesn't end up doing that, Ross seems to share the same feelings, as he mistakenly says Rachel's name while marrying Emily.</p><p>This quote was shocking, which can be heard by the gasps in the audience. This moment was so impactful, that it led to the disintegration of Ross's marriage to Emily, and it's considered one of the most memorable\u00a0parts of Ross and Rachel's timeline.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chandler-Bing-Joey-Tribianni-Friends-Q-Tip.jpg\" /></figure><p>Constantly mocking\u00a0his intelligence is probably one of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/friends-ten-worst-things-chandler-did-to-joey/\">the worst things that Chandler does to Joey on <em>Friends</em></a>, but it's almost never not funny. This one particular quote is said after Joey gets mixed up about how long he's known his tailor. Chandler then insinuates that Joey must have some form of brain damage after using a\u00a0cotton swab in his ear too harshly.</p><p>According to <em><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2017/03/148031/matthew-perry-favorite-chandler-joke\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Refinery29</a></em>,\u00a0Matthew Perry has called this quote his favorite quip on the whole show, which definitely means something when one considers how many he has made. It definitely helps break up the drama of the episode, since Rachel has to come to terms with Ross dating Julie.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/joey-food.jpg\" /></figure><p>This quote is everything for all the foodies out there. Joey arguably became more childlike as the show went on, and this affected his long-time love of food. He complains that a date took some fries off of his plate, and when Phoebe asks why that's such a problem, Joey responds with the aforementioned quote. Sure, maybe it's a selfish sentiment, but it sure is funny.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/friends-rachel-green-aged-poorly-fans-hate/\">Things Fans Hate About Rachel In Friends</a></span></p><p>Joey's petulant way of saying the quote is hilarious, and viewers probably can't imagine the quote in anything but Matt LeBlanc's voice. This is also definitely a very relatable quote, which has helped it stand the test of time as an iconic saying.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jennifer-Aniston-in-Friends-For-entry-We-were-on-a-break-gag.jpg\" /></figure><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/friends-most-romantic-ross-rachel-scenes/\">Ross and Rachel had many romantic moments</a>, but this was not one of them. During their initial breakup, when Ross sleeps with another woman, there is confusion about whether or not he cheated. According to Ross, they were on a break, so it didn't count. This led to a years-long argument between the pair, about whether or not they were on a break.</p><p>The quote\u00a0shows how toxic the pair could be at times, but it certainly is funny.\u00a0The saying has been memed relentlessly, and even the other characters started quoting it as time went on, including the guest star, Hugh Laurie.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/janice.jpeg\" /></figure><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/friends-side-characters-main-character-energy/\">Janice is a <em>Friends</em> side character with main character energy</a>, and this quote proves it. She managed to have a catchphrase that was just as iconic as the main six's sayings, in fact, this quote is probably even more memorable than a lot of them.</p><p>This quote was meant to get across how obnoxious and annoying Janice could be, and some of the other characters even mocked her by imitating her. But it became a great quote for whenever the friends became shocked at some turn of events, such as when Chandler realizes that the girl he's been chatting with online has been Janice all along.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/friends-the-one-with-the-prom-video.jpg\" /></figure><p>This quote has now pretty much become a hallmark of relationship sayings and can be found on a lot of <em>Friends</em> merch. Ross and Rachel had a very tumultuous relationship, but they definitely had their highlights. This includes when they officially get together in season 2 after Rachel sees how Ross tried to take her to her prom back in high school.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/friends-chandler-bing-hated-things/\">10 Things Fans Still Hate About Chandler In Friends</a></span></p><p>This quote is said by Phoebe, who initially uses it to convince Ross how he and Rachel are meant to be together. And when the pair eventually do get together, with all of the other friends watching on and smiling, Phoebe smirks and repeats the quote, reminding everyone how she was right all along.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pivot-1.jpg\" /></figure><p>This is definitely one of the funniest quotes in the whole show, despite only being one word. When Ross, Rachel, and Chandler try to get Ross' new couch up his stairs, they get stuck in the middle of the staircase, leading to Ross yelling at them to pivot.</p><p>Ross begins repeating this quote, getting louder and drawing out the word more and more, which makes it funnier and funnier as the scene goes on. Eventually, Chandler yells at him to shut up in the same manner, resulting in an incredibly hilarious scene. There's even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HayfgOUmU2M?t=33\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a blooper of the cast breaking down</a> in laughter during the scene's filming, which is definitely worth a watch.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/the-office-characters-friends-counterparts/\">The Office Characters &amp; Their Friends Counterparts</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 03:00:53 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 3, 0, 53, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/friends-most-iconic-quotes/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Resident Evil Village: 10 Best Quotes | Screen Rant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Resident Evil Village: 10 Best Quotes | Screen Rant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-village-best-quotes/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-village-best-quotes/", "authors": [{"name": "Adrienne Keer"}], "author": "Adrienne Keer", "author_detail": {"name": "Adrienne Keer"}, "tags": [{"term": "Lists", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Resident Evil Village has many memorable quotes, ranging from horrifying to hilarious but which stand out the most?", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Resident Evil Village has many memorable quotes, ranging from horrifying to hilarious but which stand out the most?"}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<p><em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/resident-evil-8\">Resident Evil\u00a0Village</a></em> follows Ethan Winters on his quest to find his infant daughter, Rose, who has been kidnapped and taken to a strange European village.

Elena tells him about Luiza, a resident who uses her home as a safe haven for others. His relief is short-lived when Elena's father becomes a Lycan and kills nearly everyone, leaving Elena to guide Ethan as they try to escape.</p><p>Unfortunately for Elena, she still believes she can help her father and falls to a fiery death when she turns back to him. Ethan has a moment of rage where he utters this quote, before ultimately pushing on. Although Ethan is considered a boring character, he wants to help those around him, and players can feel his frustration when he fails to help Elena to safety.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Salvatore-Moreau-in-Resident-Evil-Village.jpg\" /></figure><p>When trying to escape Moreau's reservoir and get one of Rose's flasks, Ethan finds himself going through a series of anxiety-inducing puzzles while Moreau periodically jumps out and attempts to eat him. This particular section sees Ethan navigating wooden plans on the water, so players have to concentrate, as he'll die if he falls and if he's caught.</p><p>During one puzzle, Ethan is getting close to finding a way out of the reservoir, when Moreau jumps out of nowhere and declares himself to be the best. It's a great jumpscare that's equal parts hilarious and sad. Moreau is the weakest and least liked of the Four Lords, but part of him still believes that he can defeat Ethan and impress Miranda, who he sees as a mother figure, despite the fact that he's already slowly dying as a result of her experimentation.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lady-dimitrescu-re-village.jpg\" /></figure><p>This quote follows one of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-village-most-surprising-scary-moments/\"><em>Resident Evil Village</em>'s scariest moments that took players by surprise</a>, when Lady Dimitrescu slices off Ethan's hand as he's trying to find the masks and leave the castle. She appears out of nowhere, telling Ethan he'll never get away or be reunited with his daughter. Ethan is then forced to grab his hand and run, circling back to the switch he was initially trying to pull before he can escape.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-8-lady-dimitrescu-memes/\">15 Lady Dimitrescu Memes That Are Too Much</a></span></p><p>It's a tense and dramatic moment, and even the players most enamored with Lady Dimitrescu find her intimidating in this scene. It also reaffirms the fact that she's always lurking about the castle, and players never know when or where she'll appear next, keeping them on guard.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Karl-Heisenberg-from-Resident-Evil-Village.jpg\" /></figure><p>Considered one of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-village-ten-best-characters-ranked/\">the best characters in <em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>, Heisenberg is funny and charismatic. After ambushing Ethan outside of Castle Dimitrescu, he drags him to the meeting between the Four Lords, where Miranda has the final say on who gets first dibs on him. The least loyal of the Four Lords, Heisenberg wants to persuade Ethan to work together, but first has to see how capable he is.</p><p>Heisenberg tests his endurance by having his Lycans chase Ethan through dark, dingy mine shafts, where he also has to avoid being crushed by a spiked ceiling. When he reaches the next portion, a massive wheel with huge spikes appears. Under the impression that Ethan won't survive this, Heisenberg yells this out in amusement. It's cheesy, but a funny moment, as it shows that Heisenberg underestimates Ethan's ability to find a way to survive the situation.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RE8-Chris-Redfield.jpg\" /></figure><p>There are some <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-chris-redfield-interesting-facts/\">things <em>Resident Evil</em> fans don't know about Chris Redfield</a>, and one of them is why he waits so long to tell Ethan what's going on in the village or explain what happened to Mia and Rose. After a confrontation at Heisenberg's factory, Chris finally decides it's time to come clean.</p><p>It's a bit of an unintentionally funny moment, as Chris could've said something to Ethan after shooting Miranda, who he believed to be Mia, at the beginning of the game. Instead, he waits until Miranda has Rose and is preparing for the ritual before he says anything. It's understandable that he doesn't want civilians involved, but it's clear that Ethan is no longer a normal human being at this point and is capable of handling himself.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Duke-in-Castle-Dimitrescu-in-Resident-Evil-Village.jpg\" /></figure><p>The successor to <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/resident-evil-4\">Resident Evil 4</a></em>'s weapons merchant is a helpful guide to Ethan and the player throughout the game, as he explains as much as he can about the village and its Four Lords. Ethan returns to The Duke following the battle with the mutated Lady Dimitrescu, where he reveals a disturbing piece of information about Rose.</p><p>Not only is she in the village, but her body parts have been separated into four different flasks. The flask Ethan picks up after the battle contains her head. It's a jaw-droppingly horrifying moment that foreshadows\u00a0the events that have yet to come for the player at this point.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Resident-Evil-Village-Salvatore-Moreau.jpg\" /></figure><p>Though he's not the most popular or loved of the Four Lords, Moreau does have some amusing lines. When Ethan first enters his reservoir, he sees the third flask just hanging out on a shelf while Moreau is giving himself a pep talk. Instead of just grabbing it and running away, Ethan decides it's a great idea to interrupt him to tell him he's taking it.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/hilarious-best-resident-evil-village-memes/\">10 Hilarious Resident Evil Village Memes</a></span></p><p>Moreau is quick to point out what many players likely thought in this scene, that Ethan made a bad choice and should've just taken it, instead of alerting the villain to his plans. Because he couldn't just keep his mouth shut, he finds himself trapped and forced to fight Moreau for the flask.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Child-Eveline-In-Resident-Evil-7.jpg\" /></figure><p>Eveline, one of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-games-series-powerful-monsters-ranked/\">the most powerful monsters in the <em>Resident Evil</em> games</a>, returns to Ethan while he's on the verge of death to tell him the last key piece of information he needs to know. She reveals that Jack murdered him when he arrived at the Baker house three years prior, but was infected with the mold and reanimated.</p><p>It's a creepy moment that finally explains how Ethan not only survived the events of the previous game but also how he survived everything in <em>Resident Evil Village</em>. Losing his hands has become a running gag for his character, and players wondered how he could just reattach them and not suffer major blood loss from that or any of his other injuries.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lady-Dimitrescu-with-her-daughters-in-Resident-Evil-VIllage.jpg\" /></figure><p>As one of the most popular characters in the franchise, Lady Dimitrescu has many interesting moments. One of them comes when she and her daughters mess with Ethan before hanging him up in the corner of the room. She drinks his blood and utters this line, which is humorous, but also confusing initially.</p><p>This line makes a lot more sense after Eveline reveals that Ethan's body has been taken over by the mold. Since he's no longer human, his blood doesn't taste the same. It's a cool bit of foreshadowing, as it makes the player question why she would say that.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Karl-Heisenberg-Drags-Ethan-Winters-in-Resident-Evil-Village.jpg\" /></figure><p>Having survived his encounter with Sturm, Ethan engages in a boss battle with Heisenberg. Chris blows up his factory to allow Ethan a moment to recuperate, enraging Heisenberg, declaring death on them and yelling out this line.</p><p>It's one of the most hilarious quotes in the game, as it brings up the tense relationship Chris developed with boulders in <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/resident-evil-5\">Resident Evil 5</a></em>. It's unclear how Heisenberg would know anything about Chris, but it's a funny moment that breaks the fourth wall.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/how-resident-evil-village-sets-up-next-game/\">10 Ways Resident Evil Village Sets Up Resident Evil 9</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 03:00:48 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 3, 0, 48, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-village-best-quotes/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "MCU: 10 Side Characters With Main Character Energy | Screen Rant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "MCU: 10 Side Characters With Main Character Energy | Screen Rant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/mcu-side-characters-main-character-energy/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/mcu-side-characters-main-character-energy/", "authors": [{"name": "Darby Harn"}], "author": "Darby Harn", "author_detail": {"name": "Darby Harn"}, "tags": [{"term": "Lists", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Some side characters in the MCU like Yelena Belova and Kate Bishop have big main character energy and will likely headline their own movies or shows.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Some side characters in the MCU like Yelena Belova and Kate Bishop have big main character energy and will likely headline their own movies or shows."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Warning: This list contains spoilers for</strong><em><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>Spider-Man: No Way Home</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></em><strong>and\u00a0</strong><em><strong>Hawkeye</strong><strong>.</strong></em></p><p>The MCU, like Marvel Comics, is full of iconic characters who are usually the center of attention.

The coat, which Crow says was one of the last of its kind in the world, was adorned with a few enamel pins. One of the pins was of a spider, an intentional nod to <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/yelena-black-widow-future-perfect-after-hawkeye/\">the Black Widow mantle</a>. Another pin, a disembodied hand in a \"finger gun\" pose carries two meanings.\u00a0Crow explained:</p><blockquote><p>One of them is sort of a finger gun, which was the name of a production company for Hawkeye.

Eventually, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/uncharted-movie-game-fans-newcomers-accessible-ruben-fleischer/\"><em>Zombieland: Double Tap</em> and <em>Venom</em>\u2019s Ruben Fleischer</a> became attached to direct and the film finally went into full production in 2020.</p><p>Acting as a semi-prequel to the game series, Holland plays young adventurer Nathan Drake; who finds himself drawn into the world of relics, danger and glory with his mentor <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/uncharted-movie-image-nathan-sully-argument-tom-holland/\">Sully, played here by Mark Wahlberg</a>. The long-troubled production history of the film meant that Wahlberg (who was originally cast in 2008 as the heroic Drake) became old enough to play the supporting father-figure role. Holland and Wahlberg are joined by Sophia Ali, Antonio Banderas and Tati Gabrielle among others to bring to life a screenplay penned by <em>Iron Man</em> screenwriting duo Art Marcum and Matt Holloway.

Holland recalls how some previously attached filmmakers \u201c<em>had ideas that we didn\u2019t like</em>\u201d and that led to the frequent comings and going\u2019s behind the scenes. Speaking specifically about the characterization of the protagonists, he adds \u201c<em>There were very different variations of Drake, and [\u2026] Sully</em>\u201d. Holland details how some of the directors wanted to \u201c<em>make the game</em>\u201d in a supposedly shot-for-shot fashion, while other candidates strayed from the source material drastically. The Hollywood star doesn\u2019t look back on the process all too fondly, adding \u201c<em>It\u2019s quite stressful looking for a director</em>\u201d. Read his full interview quote below:</p><blockquote><p>\"Some of [the directors] came in, and had ideas that we didn\u2019t like, that just didn\u2019t fit the characters, and we had to move on to other people. We took inspiration from everyone. There were very different variations of Drake, and very different variations of Sully.

Many consider\u00a0<em>Mad Max: Fury Road\u00a0</em>one of the best action movies ever made.</p><p>Although\u00a0<em>Fury Road\u00a0</em>is an undisputed masterpiece, its production history wasn't\u00a0anywhere close to perfect. Miller wasn't able to begin filming the third sequel until 2012 despite announcing the film in 2009, 30 years after\u00a0his original\u00a0<em>Mad Max.\u00a0</em>When production could begin, it involved dangerous, expensive scenes and reports of conflicts among the cast. Ultimately,\u00a0additional footage would be shot in 2013, then post-production would fill another year. After its premiere,\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/mad-max-fury-road-success-despite-blade-runner-2049/\"><em>Fury Road\u00a0</em>was well received</a>, but its box office sales couldn't recoup its massive budget.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/venom-2-success-mad-max-5-tom-hardy/\">Mad Max 5 With Tom Hardy Is Feeling Even Less Likely Now</a></span></p><p>With such a complicated creation process, it's no wonder that\u00a0Kyle Buchanan, a pop culture reporter for <em>The New York Times</em>, recorded the whole story in his new book.\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylebuchanan/status/1479208045196431360\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Buchanan</a> posted a teaser posted on Twitter for his book,\u00a0<em>Blood, Sweat &amp; Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, which reveals that the cast had trouble readjusting to normal life after working on the film. The excerpts Buchanan chose are quotes from some of the cast members describing how playing their roles affected them. Read what their quotes below:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Zo\u00eb Kravitz</strong>: \"I don't think we realized until it was almost over how far down the rabbit hole we had all gone. Just returning to normal life after was bizarre. None of us knew how to do it.\"</p><p><strong>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</strong>: \"It took me a long while to shake the experience and get back to feeling like myself. To even put on my own clothes and jewelry again felt bizarre.\"</p><p><strong>Charlize Theron</strong>: \"I wasn't sick one day on that movie, and then I got on the plane and by the time I landed in Los Angeles, I had bronchitis, and then it turned into pneumonia. It was like my body crashed. Every part of me went, Okay, you don't have to survive anymore. You can rest now.\"</p></blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zoe-Kravitz-as-Toast-in-Mad-Max-Fury-Road-Cropped.jpg\" /></figure><p>Both Kravitz and Huntington-Whiteley, who played wives of the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/mad-max-immortan-joe-fury-road-ending-tease/\">Immortan Joe</a> in the film, described returning to normal life as bizarre while Theron describes how her \"<em>body crashed</em>\" and she became sick once she returned home. All three quotes from the\u00a0<em>Mad Max</em> stars paint a picture of an all-consuming\u00a0experience during production.\u00a0It seems like the filming was so involved that the cast became the characters they played. Once filming finished, as Theron puts it, they had survived.</p><p>Of course, these quotes are all just snippets meant to tease interest for Buchanan's book, so it's hard to say how any of the cast members really felt about making\u00a0\u00a0<strong><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></strong> without more context. However, these quotes\u00a0reveal how much effort the cast and crew put into making the film, an effort that undoubtedly paid off.

The name is somewhat similar to Xbox Game Pass, and there might well be <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/microsoft-smartphone-surface-phone-details/\">some Microsoft history</a> behind it. Back in 2019, Taco Bell partnered with Microsoft to give away some Xbox Swag and gaming consoles.

There\u2019s a catch, however. Hungry subscribers will have to visit a nearby Taco Bell outlet to enjoy their daily taco quota. Moreover, it is non-refundable, non-transferable, and cannot be combined with any other offers.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cheese-lover-taco.jpg\" /></figure><p>The options available to Taco Lover's Pass subscribers are also quite slim, as they can only choose between seven items: Crunchy Taco, Crunchy Taco Supreme, Soft Taco, Soft Taco Supreme, Spicy Potato Soft Taco, Doritos Locos Tacos, and the Doritos Locos Tacos Supreme. As for the value proposition, here\u2019s a basic rundown. A Doritos Locos Tacos Supreme costs $2.69 on a regular day. A Taco Lover\u2019s Pass subscriber can enjoy one daily for 30 days in a row, and save $70 each month. That would also mean pumping 190 <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/asus-purego-produce-gadget/\">calories into the body</a> each day, but the subscriber already knows that.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the\u00a0similarity in Game Pass\u00a0name to Xbox will translate into real success for Taco Bell\u2019s offering, but for taco lovers who don\u2019t mind <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/animal-crossing-taco-bell-drive-thru-build/\">visiting a Taco Bell outlet</a> each day, it's a great deal.

SMH,\"</em> DJ Envy captioned a post captured by <em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CYXt7CrM3Wo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Shade Room</a></em>. In the post, Envy included a side-by-side of the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/selling-tampa-rena-frazier-age-husband-instagram-career/\"><em>Selling Tampa</em> promo poster </a>alongside <em>Selling Sunset</em>. <em>\"1 show sold no homes....NONE!!! Kind of embarrassing. The other show sells homes. Hmmm....\"</em> DJ Envy pointed out. He ended by asking his followers if they also watch both shows. Many responded with their opinions on the new series. <em>\"Ummm maybe you should watch it all the way through. They definitely sold homes,\"</em> the unofficial show fan page wrote.</p><p>Elsewhere in Envy's comments was the cast themselves responding to all of the criticism. Colony Reeves thanked the radio personality for posting about the show and said he should watch it. <em>\"If you did, you will see some homes were sold,\"</em> she added. \"<em>Keep in mind this is only season 1 and there's only so much that can be put into 30 minutes and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/selling-tampa-colony-reeves-age-instagram-career-hometown/\">8 episodes</a></em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/selling-tampa-colony-reeves-age-instagram-career-hometown/\">,\" Colony explained</a>. Envy responded and applauded the ladies. He said the show is \"<em>dope</em>\" and only wants the show producers to show them in the same \"<em>light</em>\" that <em>Selling Sunset</em> is. Anne-Sophie Petit-Frere also responded and said the office had \"<em>many closings\"</em> over the months the show was filmed. But only certain deals were aired. She also asked that one season of the show be compared to four seasons of <em>Selling Sunset</em>.</p><p>Juawana Colbert left a comment reminding everyone that she was involved with one of the biggest sales the agency has had and that did air on the show. Sharelle replied asking for an interview on DJ Envy's show and he welcomed her with open arms. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/selling-tampa-juawana-colbert-williams-age-instagram-career-hometown/\">Juawana followed up with</a> a question for the audience asking \"<em>who did you use to buy or sale your property did they look like us or no?</em>\" The strong debate highlighted the racial disparities that exist within real estate. It also shows how invested the <em><strong>Selling Tampa</strong></em> fans are in seeing the ladies succeed. Hopefully, the producers are taking notes and paying attention to what viewers want to see. If it is an issue of discrimination, it would be nice if that was touched on next season.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/selling-tampa-cast-members-most-instagram-followers/\">Selling Tampa: The Most Popular Cast Members, Based On Instagram Followers</a></span></p><p>Source:\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CYXt7CrM3Wo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Shade Room</a></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 02:30:53 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 2, 30, 53, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/selling-tampa-netflix-cast-reacts-complaints-low-sales/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "RHOC: Noella Bergener Accuses Ex James Of Delaying Their Divorce", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "RHOC: Noella Bergener Accuses Ex James Of Delaying Their Divorce"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/real-housewives-orange-county-noella-bergener-james-divorce/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/real-housewives-orange-county-noella-bergener-james-divorce/", "authors": [{"name": "Chukwudi Onyewuchi"}], "author": "Chukwudi Onyewuchi", "author_detail": {"name": "Chukwudi Onyewuchi"}, "tags": [{"term": "Reality TV", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "The Real Housewives of Orange County star Noella Bergener accuses her estranged husband James Bergener of slowing down their divorce proceedings.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "The Real Housewives of Orange County star Noella Bergener accuses her estranged husband James Bergener of slowing down their divorce proceedings."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<p>&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/James-and-Noella-divorce.jpg\" /></figure><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-real-housewives-of-orange-county/\">The Real Housewives of Orange County</a></strong></em>'s newcomer Noella Bergener, who has been documenting her divorce on the Bravo reality series' 16th season, has accused her estranged husband James Bergener of delaying their divorce proceedings. Noella and James have been top of the headlines since their divorce proceedings began airing on the fan-favorite reality TV series. Since the legal battle began, Noella has laid a series of complaints, including accusing James of denying her access to their finances by restricting her access to her credit cards.</p><p>Noella, who has seemingly held nothing back in <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/real-housewives-orange-county-shocked-noella-divorce-james/\">her legal battle with James</a>, also stated that James refused to pay rents. Hence, she was squatting at their 10,000 square foot mansion, which she said was \"very eerie.\" However, despite her concerns about not being able to pay the bills, Noella noted she isn't scared of working and providing for her family. The Bravo celebrity further made headlines when she claimed in a December 2021 episode of <em>RHOC</em> that James has abandoned their autistic 2-year-old son James Jr., which he has since addressed.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/real-housewives-orange-county-noella-bergener-trivia-details/\">RHOC: Everything To Know About Newbie Noella Bergener</a></span></p><p>James said Noella's accusations against him were false. He also claimed to have paid substantial amounts in childcare, housing, health insurance, and other expenses for his son. James added that he also paid amounts that supplement Noella\u2019s lifestyle. Following James' statement, his attorney revealed that he filed for divorce in Puerto Rico in July 2021 and that the proceedings were finalized in December 2021. However, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rhoc-noella-bergener-ex-divorce-custody-instagram/\">Noella seemingly rubbished James' attorney's words</a> while speaking with host Andy Cohen during Wednesday's episode of <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6VWkc_SkLM&amp;feature=emb_imp_woyt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Watch What Happens Live</a></em>. Noella said James hasn't finalized their separation and described their ongoing divorce as <em>\"ridiculous.\"</em> The reality star addressed James directly by saying, <em>\"I mean c'mon dude, wrap this thing up.\"</em></p><p>Andy then brought up some of James's statements on social media, one of which noted that Noella was dead set on joining <em>RHOC</em> and had prevented him from seeing their son amid their divorce. In response to this, Noella said, <em>\"All that can be disproved because he's the one who signed up for this show, who filmed for this show, who signed releases for the show so all that's like boy, bye stuff. But that he's saying that <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rhoc-noella-bergener-son-autism-diagnosis/\">I've held him up from seeing his son</a> for, we're going on month six now, that's just absolutely absurd and that's you know, see your kid! Get on a plane.\"</em> When asked if James had returned her credit cards, Noella simply said it was messy and added, <em>\"Sign buddy. You want this to stop? Sign. Let's be done with this.\"</em></p><p>As <em><strong>The Real Housewives of Orange County</strong></em> fans continue to watch newbie Noella and James's legal battle unfold on screen, it no doubt gets harder to predict what future developments will be as both of them continue making allegations against each other and have failed to reach a compromise. With James' attorney noting that the divorce has been finalized and Noella's counter-statement, viewers are most likely to remain further confused about the real situation. However, if one is to believe <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rhoc-noella-bergener-great-addition-franchise-explained/\">Noella's side of the story</a>, then they can only hope James listens to her pleas for him to sign and end their legal battle.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rhoc-noella-bergener-first-impression-housewives-costars/\">RHOC: Noella Bergener Reveals First Impression Of Her Fellow Housewives</a></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6VWkc_SkLM&amp;feature=emb_imp_woyt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</a>/YouTube</p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 02:28:41 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 2, 28, 41, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/real-housewives-orange-county-noella-bergener-james-divorce/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Andrew Garfield Breaks Silence On Spider-Man: No Way Home", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Andrew Garfield Breaks Silence On Spider-Man: No Way Home"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/andrew-garfield-breaks-silence-on-spider-man-no-way-home/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/andrew-garfield-breaks-silence-on-spider-man-no-way-home/", "authors": [{"name": "Rachel Labonte"}], "author": "Rachel Labonte", "author_detail": {"name": "Rachel Labonte"}, "tags": [{"term": "Movie News", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Now that Spider-Man: No Way Home is out in the world, Andrew Garfield finally stops denying he&#039;s in it and opens up about what it was like being back.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Now that Spider-Man: No Way Home is out in the world, Andrew Garfield finally stops denying he&#039;s in it and opens up about what it was like being back."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Andrew-Garfield-as-Peter-Parker-in-The-Amazing-Spider-Man.jpg\" /></figure><p>After spending all of 2021 denying his involvement with\u00a0<strong><em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming-3/\">Spider-Man: No Way Home</a></em></strong><em>,\u00a0</em>Andrew Garfield has opened up about his involvement with\u00a0<em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>. It was the worst kept secret in Hollywood: <em>No Way Home</em>, the MCU's third Spidey movie <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/martin-scorsese-superhero-movies-criticism-tom-holland-response/\">with Tom Holland</a> in the lead, brings back multiple actors from the character's previous franchises. The film features a multiversal twist that allows different villains and Peter Parkers from alternate universes to suit up alongside Holland in the MCU. Though Marvel and Sony clearly wished to keep certain cameos a secret, reports and leaked images thoroughly wrecked their efforts.</p><p>For his part, though, Garfield tried his best to keep things under wraps. A running joke throughout the year became how Garfield, while promoting non-superhero movies like\u00a0<em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em> and\u00a0<em>tick, tick... BOOM!</em>, would get asked repeatedly <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-andrew-garfield-rumors-response/\">whether he was in\u00a0<em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em></a>. He vehemently insisted he wasn't, to the point where now fans are claiming he deserves an Oscar for his performance in interviews throughout the year. As many know by now, Garfield, alongside Tobey Maguire, once again plays Peter Parker in\u00a0<em>No Way Home</em>\u00a0following his time in Sony's two\u00a0<em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> movies.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/amazing-spiderman-andrew-garfield-return-likely-maguire/\">Why Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man Return Is More Likely Than Tobey Maguire</a></span></p><p>Now that\u00a0<em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> has been out for nearly a month, Garfield has broken his silence in a new interview with\u00a0<em>Variety.\u00a0</em>After touching upon topics like what brought him back to the character and whether he would ever do it again (the answer is yes, if it feels right!), Garfield revealed just what it means to him to get the chance to redeem his Spider-Man. Though now it feels like everyone is singing his praises, the\u00a0<em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> movies are among the least beloved superhero movies of the past decade, and Garfield himself has been open about his disappointment with them. With\u00a0<em>No Way Home</em>, though, he feels much better, as he explained:</p><blockquote><p>I am so grateful. I\u2019m just really, really grateful that I got to tie up some loose ends for the Peter that I was playing. I love that character and I\u2019m grateful that I got to work with these incredible actors, this incredible director, and Marvel in conjunction with Sony. It was joyful, and a feeling of closure for me. There was so many unanswered questions for my Peter, where we left it. I got to step back in and get some healing for him. And also really supporting [Holland\u2019s] Peter, and honoring his character completing that trilogy, not distracting or detracting from it.</p></blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/andrew-garfield-spider-man-no-way-home.jpg\" /></figure><p>Since\u00a0<em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> was released, fans have flooded social media with calls for Sony to make\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/andrew-garfield-stunt-double-amazing-spiderman-3-response/\"><em>Th</em><em>e Amazing Spider-Man 3</em> with Garfield</a> back in the lead. His iteration of the character might've drawn mixed responses back in 2012 and 2014, but now there's renewed admiration for all Garfield brought to the character. As he said in the new interview,\u00a0<em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> was all about closure for him, and that's a pretty remarkable thing.</p><p>Now many fans will surely be wondering what comes next. Right now, there are no official plans to bring Garfield back, though there have been numerous rumors flying around on social media. For example, some fans hope and believe that the recent delay for Sony's\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/morbius-movie-delay-spiderman-andrew-garfield-fans-response/\"><em>Morbius</em> has to do with an added Garfield scene</a>. That might not be the case, but it's very clear there is a lot of interest in seeing him suit up again. If he doesn't, though, at least\u00a0<strong><em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em></strong> gave him the perfect final installment he was denied years ago.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"next-single\">More:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/andrew-garfield-amazing-spiderman-3-return-perfect-future/\">Andrew Garfield's Perfect Spider-Man Future Is As Sony's Spidey</a></span></p><p>Source: Variety</p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 02:18:31 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 2, 18, 31, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/andrew-garfield-breaks-silence-on-spider-man-no-way-home/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "The Bachelor: Sierra Jackson's Age, Instagram, Job, Hometown & More", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "The Bachelor: Sierra Jackson's Age, Instagram, Job, Hometown & More"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/bachelor-sierra-jackson-age-instagram-job-hometown-clayton/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/bachelor-sierra-jackson-age-instagram-job-hometown-clayton/", "authors": [{"name": "Mackenzie Long"}], "author": "Mackenzie Long", "author_detail": {"name": "Mackenzie Long"}, "tags": [{"term": "Reality TV", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Sierra Jackson is one of the 31 women vying for Clayton Echard&#039;s rose on season 26 of The Bachelor.

The games have been highly successful critically and financially and have gained a passionate loyal fanbase over the years for their unique worldbuilding, colorful cast of supporting characters, and fun interactive gameplay.</p><p>Interest in a <em>Fallout</em> adaptation had been in discussion since the 2000s, yet no traction was ever made. In 2020, Amazon Studio acquired the rights to develop <em>Fallout</em> into a television series and landed<em> Westworld</em> creators, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, as executive producers on the series. However, no further development was made, with Bethesda Game Studios executive producer,\u00a0Todd Howard, saying\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/fallout-tv-show-production-update-todd-howard-response/\">the <em>Fallout\u00a0</em>series was still moving forward</a> as of November 2021.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/fallout-amazon-tv-show-game-needs-avoid/\">What Amazon's Fallout TV Show Needs To Avoid From The Game</a></span></p><p><em>Variety</em> has now confirmed that Nolan will not only be an executive producer on the series but will direct the pilot.

HBO is in the middle of filming a series based on <em>The Last of Us</em>, and\u00a0Netflix is developing a live-action <em>Pokemon</em> series.\u00a0<em>Fallout i</em>sn't the only major video game Amazon is developing, as it was reported back in November 2021 that the company was looking at <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/mass-effect-tv-show-amazon-development-details/\">developing <em>Mass Effect</em> into a television series</a>.</p><p>The <em>Fallout</em> games have a rich mythology and lore to explore,\u00a0yet similarly to <em>Mass Effect</em>, the series will have to overcome the obstacle of making a lead character for a series that is defined by the player's individual actions. The creators are also left to decide to either adapt the games into a story or tell an original story that takes place within the same world of the games with passing references to it. The medium of television certainly gives the showrunners and Nolan more time to expand on the world of <em><strong>Fallout</strong> </em>and possibly avoid issues that have plagued video game adaptations\u00a0for years.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/video-game-tv-shows-not-movies-reasons-why/\">Why So Many Video Game TV Shows Are Happening Now</a></span></p><p>Source: Variety</p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 02:11:11 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 2, 11, 11, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/fallout-show-amazon-jonathan-nolan-director-showrunner-update/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "OnePlus Just Confirmed A Bunch Of OnePlus 10 Pro Camera Upgrades", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "OnePlus Just Confirmed A Bunch Of OnePlus 10 Pro Camera Upgrades"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/oneplus-10-pro-camera-specs-features-announce-ces-2022/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/oneplus-10-pro-camera-specs-features-announce-ces-2022/", "authors": [{"name": "Joe Maring"}], "author": "Joe Maring", "author_detail": {"name": "Joe Maring"}, "tags": [{"term": "Tech", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "OnePlus just shared all of the new camera features for the OnePlus 10 Pro.

Samsung announced the Galaxy S21 FE, Hisense revealed its new lineup of Mini LED TVs, and Intel showcased\u00a0a slew of new 12th Gen CPUs.</p><p>Alongside all of that, OnePlus has also had a constant presence during CES. The company announced the OnePlus 10 Pro on January 3 and unveiled its official design. Then, on January 4, OnePlus confirmed many of the phone's top specs \u2014 <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/snapdragon8-gen1-benchmarks-explained/\">including a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset</a>, 5000 mAh battery, and 80W wired charging. OnePlus\u00a0also announced\u00a0some of the 10 Pro's\u00a0camera details, confirming a 48MP primary camera, a 50MP ultra-wide camera, an 8MP telephoto camera. Fast forward to January 6, and OnePlus has now shared what these new cameras will actually be capable of.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/oneplus-10-pro-specs-announce-processor-display-camera-official/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OnePlus 10 Pro Specs Were Just Announced \u2014 Here's What's Confirmed</a></span></p><p>Building upon its upgraded color tuning introduced with the OnePlus 9 Pro, the OnePlus 10 Pro introduces what OnePlus is calling its\u00a0'Billion Color Solution.' It takes the Natural Color Calibration released last year and applies it to over a billion colors. This makes the 10 Pro the first OnePlus <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/smartphones/\">smartphone</a> capable of capturing full 10-bit color with its photos \u2014 with that applying to all three camera sensors.\u00a0Compared to the 9 Pro, the OnePlus 10 Pro also captures 25 percent more DCI-P3 colors and can process 64x more colors in general. If this works <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">as OnePlus claims</a>, it should result in substantially more natural and 'delicate' colors across all three sensors.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oneplus-10-pro-camera-sample-sea.jpg\" /></figure><p>Perhaps even more exciting, the OnePlus 10 Pro adds an all-new shooting mode called 'RAW+.' <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/apple-iphone-proraw-camera-what/\">Like Apple ProRAW</a>, RAW+ captures images in a RAW format with the OnePlus 10 Pro's\u00a0<em>\"computational photography elements\"</em>\u00a0still intact.<em>\u00a0</em>Similarly, RAW shooting is now possible with the primary, ultra-wide, and telephoto cameras on the 10 Pro (something reserved just for the primary camera\u00a0on the OnePlus 9 Pro). Speaking of the ultra-wide camera, this year's sensor is now upgraded to a\u00a0150\u00b0 FoV. OnePlus says this is\u00a0<em>\"up to four times wider than traditional ultra-wide cameras\"\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>\"allows users to capture even more in their shots.\"\u00a0</em>Users can switch to a 110\u00b0 mode if the 150\u00b0 view is too much, or enable the new Fisheye\u00a0Mode to\u00a0<em>\"replicate the look of dedicated fisheye cameras.\"</em></p><p>Last but certainly not least, OnePlus is <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/iphone-cinematic-mode-videos-record-edit-how/\">also addressing video recording</a> with its new Movie Mode. Movie Mode grants OnePlus 10 Pro users much greater control over their filming, offering adjustments to things like ISO and shutter speed. This also allows users to record videos in LOG for improved dynamic range and easier editing.</p><p>While a lot of testing needs to happen before we can make any final judgments, these all sound like welcome improvements for the OnePlus 10 Pro. Last year's OnePlus 9 Pro didn't have a bad camera system. In fact, it was actually quite good. If <strong>OnePlus</strong> has improved the colors as much as it claims, that alone should make the 10 Pro worth shooting with. Combined with the much wider ultra-wide camera and RAW+ mode, and there's potentially a lot to like here.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/oneplus-buds-z2-vs-oneplus-buds-pro-comparison/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OnePlus Buds Z2 Vs.

The\u00a02nd installment in the <em>Mario Party</em> series for Nintendo Switch was released only a couple of months ago.\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/mario-party-superstars-all-minigames-list/\"><em>Mario Party Superstars</em> pays homage to past installments</a> in the series by featuring both 100 past mini-games from other installments and five remade boards from the Nintendo 64 trilogy.</p><p>Bowser Jr. is the son of Bowser - the evil king of the Koopas and usually the main antagonist in the <em>Mario Party</em> series. Though Junior has joined his father in distressing players in past entries of the series, the little monster was also made a playable character in previous <em>Mario Party</em> games. <em>Mario Party Superstars</em> does not offer Bowser Jr. as an option for gamers to choose from, but Bowser Jr. does make an appearance in the game - especially in the\u00a0encyclopedia in the data house via the main menu. The game's encyclopedia contains an extensive character library. Like all other characters that have appeared in <em>Mario Party</em>, Bowser Jr. can be seen with a description and the game art cover of the game the character starred in. Each character entry in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/mario-party-superstars-encyclopedia-series-history-lore-characters/\"><em>Mario Party Superstars'\u00a0</em>encyclopedia</a> includes a familiar trait and sound effect. Though this is a great touch for fans of the series' characters, one fan was disappointed that Bowser Jr. is not a playable character.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/mario-party-superstars-big-boo-star-stealing-power/\">Mario Party Superstars: Big Boo's Star-Stealing Power Is Still The Worst</a></span></p><p>As reported by <a href=\"https://gamerant.com/mario-party-superstars-bowser-jr-mod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Game Rant</em></a>, a <em>Mario Party Superstars</em> fan and modder has created a mod for the game that lets players be Bowser Jr. YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4fqXvdmDDw&amp;ab_channel=Sgt.Spike\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sgt. Spike</a> shared a video on their channel showcasing the mod in action. In the video, Junior is seen advancing along the game board, competing in minigames, and even interacting with characters. As stated in the notes on Sgt. Spike's <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/348137\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>GameBanana</em></a> entry for the Bowser Jr.\u00a0mod, the mod fully replaces <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/mario-party-superstars-unlockable-characters-maps-mistake/\"><em>Mario Party Superstars'</em> playable characters</a> Mario, Daisy, or Birdo. Bowser Jr.'s model was created via a combination of new animations and animations imported from the previous Super Mario Party. The mod also features Bowser Jr. voice clips, custom icons, and even three new Junior stickers.</p><p>Sgt. Spike mentions a couple of bugs that they need to fix. For example, the modder mentions that they think Bowser Jr.'s animations do not look very good because the animations haven't been replaced fully yet, specifically in a couple of the minigames. For the same reason, Junior seems to hold specific items incorrectly. In fact, when Bowser Junior receives an item, the camera focuses on the monster's feet and not his face. Finally, his icon does not always fit in the character select screens' portraits and the portraits of the post-minigames results screen. Sgt. Spike does mention that they will make further improvements in the future.</p><p>Perhaps in a <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/mario-party-superstars-dlc-gamecube-wii-n64-games/\"><em>Mario Party Superstars'</em> DLC, characters</a> like Bowser Jr. will be made an official playable character.

That isn't a typo, the car actually traveled nearly twice as far as what's normally possible. Tesla keeps finding ways to boost the range of its vehicles but that usually means double-digit increases and while that is welcome, it doesn't really change charging behavior dramatically.</p><p>The first Tesla car, the Roadster had a range just over 200 miles, which was quite impressive for a fast and sporty electric vehicle in 2008. In modern Tesla vehicles, the range starts at 272 miles for <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tesla-model-3-model-y-price-increases-last-year/\">the lowest cost Model 3</a>\u00a0and goes as high as 404 miles with the Model S. The Model 3 Long Range can travel 358 miles on a charge, with the Model X and Model Y Long Range coming in third and fourth.

While it isn't a standard Tesla, only one major change was made with the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tesla-new-battery-type-fire-risk/\">replacement of the battery</a>. A company called Our Next Energy or ONE, put a prototype battery pack into a Tesla Model S and drove the incredible distance without recharging. The Gemini 001 battery has a capacity of 203.7 kilowatt-hours, about <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tesla-model-s-long-range-vs-plaid-vs-plaid-plus-comparison/\">double that of a Model S</a>, so traveling nearly twice as far makes sense. The drive was documented in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fWj2YCdoc9A\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube video</a>\u00a0that's shortened to just under three minutes to make the uneventful trip\u00a0go by faster.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tesla-Model-S-With-Battery-Highlighted.jpg\" /></figure><p>On the company's <a href=\"https://one.ai/range/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, ONE describes how the results were verified. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-quarter-mile-speed-time-jay-leno/\">The Tesla Model S test vehicle</a>\u00a0was retrofitted with ONE's experimental battery and placed on a dynamometer, which allows the wheels to turn while the car remains locked in place. With no wind drag and less friction than the real-world test, the modified Tesla Model S achieved 882 miles on a single charge, while registering a speed of 55 mph.</p><p>The\u00a0founder and CEO of ONE, Mujeeb Ijaz, was previously Senior Director of Special Projects Energy Storage at Apple, and ONE is backed by Bill Gates and BMW as well. That means the company didn't simply\u00a0come out of nowhere to make such a big claim. However, this is the first big <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tesla-model-travel-distance-range-single-charge-explained/\">showing of its advanced battery technology</a> and there are still plenty of unknowns, such as charging rate and method, durability, and lifespan.

Fans were furious to discover how many franchise villains were included in the cast for the second season of the spin-off dating show. If <em>Before The 90 Days</em> didn\u2019t offer new couples and fresh plot lines, many viewers had voiced they would be done with the franchise. Now that new couples are being featured,<em> 90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em> fans hope that the future of the franchise sees a steady stream of fresh romances while stale and scripted plot lines and problematic cast members remain in 2021.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Natalie-Mordovtseva-90-Day-The-Single-Life.jpg\" /></figure><p>Natalie Mordovtseva is one franchise cast member who many viewers believe has overstayed her welcome. Natalie and her now-estranged husband Mike Youngquist aired their unhappy relationship\u00a0in several consecutive seasons of franchise content that left viewers fast-forwarding through their segments. Though many viewers think <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-couples-equally-flawed-natalie-mike/\">Mike is just as bad as Natalie</a>, Natalie was called out for her eccentric ways and demeaning attitude. Viewers were unhappy to discover that Natalie continued in the franchise after their split, as she now appears on\u00a0<i>The\u00a0Single Life</i>. Natalie has been called out\u00a0for being rude, delusional, condescending, arrogant, and all-around unpleasant to watch.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Big-Ed-Liz-Married-In-90-Day-Fiance.jpg\" /></figure><p>Big Ed Brown is one cast member who left viewers furious when he continued to be cast in new franchise content. Like Natalie, Big Ed continues to appear in the franchise on\u00a0<em>The Single Life\u00a0</em>season 2. However, Big Ed has even more serious complaints against him. Viewers first watched Big Ed demean and insult his partner Rose Vega on\u00a0<i>Before The 90 Days</i>. His relationship with Liz Woods on\u00a0<i>The\u00a0Single Life\u00a0</i>season 1 then troubled viewers due to how Big Ed pursued her without consent. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-liz-woods-big-ed-engagement/\">Big Ed was then slammed by viewers </a>once an abusive phone call he sent Liz was leaked, while accusations of abuse have also been made against him by an anonymous woman.

However, Angela has since been panned\u00a0for her increasingly alarming behavior. Angela misled her younger husband Michael Ilesanmi about her ability to have kids and her desire for them. She then treated her husband in a controlling and abusive manner that included yelling at him and trying to illegally stalk him. Now, Angela has become preoccupied with her appearance as she focuses on fixing her outsides and not her insides. Viewers are extremely tired of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-angela-deem-calls-fan-dumb/\">Angela's vulgar and abusive behavior</a> and no longer think she should appear in TLC content, especially after she flashed her breasts at the\u00a0<em>Happily Ever After\u00a0</em>season 6 reunion.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-cast-members-accused-mean-spirited/\">90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Cast Members Accused Of Being Mean-Spirited</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.jpg\" /></figure><p>Steven Johnston joined the cast of\u00a0<em>The Other Way\u00a0</em>season 3 and quickly became absolutely loathed among viewers. Steven attempted to use his Mormon faith to control his now-wife Alina. Steven expected Alina to abide by all of the rules of his religion, including being a virgin until marriage and not drinking alcohol or caffeine. However, Steven admitted to having sex with multiple women, including when he was dating Alina. The season reunion then revealed that Steven was talking to nearly a dozen women online behind Alina's back. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-stevens-vanessa-tell-all-mvp/\">Steven's ex-girlfriend Vanessa</a> even arrived to warn Alina that Steven was a liar and to call him out for his predatory and hypocritical behavior. Despite all of this, Alina decided to stay with Steven.\u00a0<em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9\u00a0</em>fans are hoping that the couple will never be featured again given Steven's appalling behavior.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Libby-Potthast-Andrei-Castravet-Eleanor-90-Day-Fiance-Happily-Ever-After.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Libby and Andrei Castravet may have had the most stable marriage on\u00a0<em>Happily Ever After\u00a0</em>season 6, but the duo came across as very unlikable to viewers. Both Libby and Andrei have been called out for being arrogant, entitled, and spoiled. However, viewers were extremely sick of the couple due to their never-ending feud with Libby's family. The Potthast family drama came across as incredibly scripted to viewers, as fans <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-libby-sister-becky-feud-andrei/\">watched the Potthast sisters fight on TV</a> while having fun together on social media. Many viewers accused the family of faking their drama so that Libby and her sisters could follow in the footsteps of franchise star Chantel Jimeno and secure their own spin-off show.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jesse-Meester-Jeniffer-Tarazona-Darcey-Silva-In-90-Day-Fiance-3.jpg\" /></figure><p>Jesse Meester and Jeniffer Tarazona found romance with each other after splitting from their former\u00a0<em>Before The 90 Days\u00a0</em>partners. The duo is currently appearing on\u00a0<i>The\u00a0Single Life</i>, where their romance is accused of being incredibly awkward and lackluster to watch. Many viewers have questioned if Jesse and Jeniffer are faking their relationship for a storyline. Viewers already intensely disliked Jesse after his disastrous relationship with Darcey Silva, and his behavior with Jeniffer isn't redeeming him for fans. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-jesse-meester-hints-marriage-jeniffer/\">Jesse and Jeniffer are making</a> many\u00a0<em><strong>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</strong>\u00a0</em>fans cringe, as they are now selling naked calendars online.

As voiced by Nicolas Cage, that particular Spider-Man gained his powers from a spider idol during the Great Depression. He battled mobsters more than he did costumed villains, but the retro approach to his origin story isn't what made him such a hit.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/spider-man-into-spider-verse-best-superhero-movie/\">10 Ways Into The Spider-Verse Is The Best Superhero Movie</a></span></p><p>With Cage's approach, the anachronistic phrases and the hardboiled detective bit made him the polar opposite of\u00a0Miles Morales' Spider-Man, on the surface anyway.

Given Cage's turn as a myriad of big-screen characters, putting him in the live-action driver's seat of Spider-Man Noir's live-action MCU debut would be a thrill ride for fans.</p><p>His age means viewers would most likely get an older version of the character. His ability to marry optimism with the world-weariness of a man who's spent a lot of time in the trenches would add layers of complexity to the role. If anyone could pull off a veteran Spider-Man Noir in an across-the-multiverse Spider-adventure, it's the guy who voiced him on the big screen once before.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Milo Ventimiglia</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/this-is-us-mandy-moore-milo-ventimiglia.jpg\" /></figure><p>If previous Spider-Man Noir actors are given consideration, then Milo Ventimiglia of\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/this-is-us/\">This Is Us</a></em> deserves a mention as well. Ventimiglia \u2014 who first played an on-screen superpowered individual in the NBC series\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/heroes/\">Heroes</a></em> \u2014 voiced the character in season 3 of\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/ultimate-spider-man/\">Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors</a></em> in a storyline that borrowed elements of the\u00a0<em>Into the Spider-Verse</em> saga.</p><p>As a voice actor, he succinctly captured the hero's gravitas and bleak demeanor, and while he's older than Spider-Man Noir at the outset of his costumed adventures, Ventimiglia behind the mask and goggles, hunting Nazis amid the chaotic landscape of the 1930s, would be a welcome addition to the MCU.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Rami Malek</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rami-malek-no-time-to-die-james-bond.jpg\" /></figure><p>As the central star of\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/mr-robot/\">Mr. Robot</a></em>, Malek proved he has what it takes to play a young man with many skills who often finds himself in over his head. On film, whether he's playing the mercurial Freddie Mercury or the scarred-but-scary Safin opposite Daniel Craig's James Bond, he proved he has the chops to bring in box office dollars as well.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rami-malek-movies-best-imdb/\">The 10 Best Rami Malek Movies (According To IMDb)</a></span></p><p>Given the understated nature of Spider-Man Noir that's a far different personality type than his more flamboyant counterparts, any actor who takes on the role needs to do a lot with a little, and Malek's quiet resolve would work well in such a scenario. He's expressed an interest in joining the MCU in the past, so whether he would be satisfied with a relatively obscure role remains to be seen, but he's undoubtedly qualified to bring it to life.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Elijah Wood</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lord-of-the-rings-elijah-wood-books.jpg\" /></figure><p>Although he turned 40 last year, the youthful good looks of the actor everyone knows as <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/lord-rings-frodo-baggins-most-tragic-heartbreaking-character/\">Frodo Baggins from\u00a0<em>The Lord of the Rings</em></a> franchise would enable him to play Spider-Man Noir at any age. One downside: Wood communicates a great deal with his eyes, a trait that would be hampered by the character's aviator goggles.</p><p>Still, Wood has shown a penchant for embracing obscure roles with plenty of outside-the-box potential, such as the 2019 horror-comedy\u00a0<em>Come to Daddy</em>. Seeing him cinch up the trench coat and match wits and brawn with the Depression-era underworld would be a sweet payoff for fans of both Wood and Spider-Man Noir.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Hayden Christensen</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones.jpg\" /></figure><p>Christensen is already back in the Disney+ saddle for <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/possible-roles-anakin-skywalker-plays-obi-wan-kenobi-tv-show/\">a role as Darth Vader</a> in the forthcoming <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/obi-wan/\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a></em> series on the streaming network, which might make him receptive to an offer for a role in the studio's other tentpole franchise. Like any other actor who might be cast as Spider-Man Noir, Christensen would spend a lot of time wearing the character's mask, which might be a good thing for reluctant casting agents who feel he's too closely associated with his turn as Anakin Skywalker.</p><p>If there's one trait at which Christensen excels, however, it's brooding \u2014 and given the steampunk treatment of Spider-Man Noir, the characters call for a lot of that. Combined with his obvious willingness to be a part of\u00a0potential blockbusters, Christensen may be an outside-the-box choice to bring the character to the MCU.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joseph-Gordon-Levitt-Super-Pumped.jpg\" /></figure><p>With parts in\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-dark-knight-rises/\">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em> and\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/sin-city-2/\">Sin City: A Dame to Kill For</a></em>, Gordon-Levitt has shown he's not averse to playing characters based on those from comic books, and with plenty of experience as a character actor, he might very well fit the bill. He's also mastered an ability to veer from both a kind softness and a determined steeliness that would be necessary to effectively capture Spider-Man Noir's emotional range.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/7500-facts-about-joseph-gordon-levitt/\">10 Facts You Did Not Know About Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a></span></p><p>Like other contenders, Gordon-Levitt's age (he turned 40 in 2021) may be a hindrance to filmmakers who want to create a Spider-Man Noir origin story.

As part of a larger ensemble, he wouldn't be required to carry the film, and the ability to relax and have fun with it would be a treat for Marvel fans ready to see some bigger names join the fold.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Nicholas Hoult</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Great-Season-2-Peter-Nicholas-Hoult.jpg\" /></figure><p>There's Marvel precedent for Nicholas Hoult's inclusion in the MCU, given his turn as Hank McCoy/Beast in the\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/x-men-first-class/\">X-Men: First Class</a></em> series of films. On top of that, Hoult's acting as clueless Russian emperor Peter III in Hulu's\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-great/\">The Great</a></em> is wickedly funny in a way that could bring some of the more anachronistic humor of the Spider-Man Noir character to the forefront of any MCU film of which he's a part.</p><p>At the same time, Hoult has tackled meatier fare that displays a surprising amount of gravitas that's necessary to ground such a role. Of all the candidates on the shortlist of those who might be cast as Spider-Man Noir in the MCU, Hoult's range surely puts him near the top of the list.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dune-Part-1-Zendaya-Timothee-Chalamet.jpg\" /></figure><p>In a way, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has already nailed a script with an origin story similar to that of Peter Parker's.

Though she can be very friendly, she is also a fierce competitor who can throw shade as well as anyone. She is one of the show's most quotable queens and can be counted on to say something hilarious every time she is on the screen.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alaska-RuPauls-Drag-Race.jpg\" /></figure><p>Though most of her funniest moments came when she was verbally dressing another queen down during the competition, Alaska could also be wise with her humor. Alaska is always one to keep it real and her quote about the realities of drag hit home.</p><p>The quote is particularly funny because she comes to the aid of someone who is being picked on and yet she is able to be witty at the same time. Though queens are often over-the-top, Alaska also showed that she was real underneath all of the character work.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/RuPaul-in-RuPauls-Drag-Race.jpg\" /></figure><p>Few were spared the wrath of Alaska's shady wit, even the host of the show, RuPaul. Alaska's barb was perfectly in character for her and she manages to be funny and ditzy at the same time while insulting someone. A big part of drag is humor and Alaska showed that she contained all of the necessary pieces to be a drag superstar.</p><p>Though the quote makes little sense, it shows that Alaska isn't afraid to take down anyone, even <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rupauls-drag-race-things-didnt-know-rupaul/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">someone as revered as RuPaul</a>. The barb was well received and it was just another illustration of her illustrious sense of humor.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-Edwards-on-Drag-Race-Untucked.jpg\" /></figure><p>During her time on the show, Alyssa Edwards managed to rub a lot of people the wrong way and she's had feuds with several competitors. However, few could cut her down to size quite as simply as Alaska. While Alyssa applied a face mask Alaska delivered a perfectly timed remark.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rupauls-drag-race-every-season-ranked-worst-best/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">All 13 Seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race Ranked Worst To Best\u00a0</a></span></p><p>The simplicity of the insult is what makes it so hilarious and the delivery was spot on. Alyssa's self-serious attitude always adds to the humor of the situation as she can always be counted on to be stung by every barb thrown at her.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Detox-Drag-Race.jpg\" /></figure><p>One of the most anticipated parts of any season of the show is the stand-up roast sessions that happen between contestants. Competitors are able to show off their <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rupauls-drag-race-funniest-queens/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">senses of humor on <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em></a> as well as throw shade at others under the guise of a friendly jest.</p><p>Alaska excelled in those situations and she was particularly pointed with certain competitors. Though she has expressed interest in plastic surgery herself on several occasions, she isn't afraid to wield it as a weapon to take down Detox.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/alaska-money.jpg\" /></figure><p>Sometimes, Alaska manages to be very genuine when she says something funny. She is clever enough that even her compliments can come off as humorous and her imploring Detox is one such moment. Though she threw barbs at her all season, it is clear that she has a respect for Detox and saw her as fierce competition.</p><p>Alaska is so funny because she is a queen for all occasions and she never runs out of funny things to say. Even when giving a tremendous compliment to a serious competitor, she makes a memorable joke out of the moment. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/10-queens-who-lost-rupauls-drag-race-but-went-on-to-have-great-careers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Though she didn't win her orginal season</a>, she became a fan favorite and went on to win <em>All Stars 2</em> (without paying any bribes).</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Chaz-Bono.jpg\" /></figure><p>One of the funniest things about Alaska is that sometimes it is difficult to tell if she is being genuine or not. Though shadiness is a trademark feature of\u00a0<em>Drag Race\u00a0</em>competitors, Alaska seemed specifically suited for the job.</p><p>It's obvious that Cher is an icon within the drag community but Alaska couldn't help but make a seemingly sarcastic remark about Cher's son. Though she did seem to have reverence for Chaz, it is obvious that she would have preferred Cher herself.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rupauls-drag-race-snatch-game-alaska-mae-west.jpg\" /></figure><p>Though all drag is essentially character work, the\u00a0<em>Snatch Game\u00a0</em>segment of the show gives the queens a chance to show off their acting skill. Alaska chose to portray legendary screen star Mae West and she exquisitely lampooned the actresses personality to hilarious result.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/youngest-queens-rupauls-drag-race/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The 10 Youngest RuPaul's Drag Race Queens\u00a0</a></span></p><p>By adding bits of her own character to the part, Alaska showed that she understood what she was doing when playing West. Most\u00a0of the show's best competitors excel at the\u00a0<em>Snatch Game\u00a0</em>and Alaska's memorable contributions are no exception.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/RuPauls-Drag-Race-Alaska.jpg\" /></figure><p>In comedy, timing is everything and Alaska frequently proved that she was the queen of a perfectly timed joke. The incorporation of a physical element to the joke only helped to elevate it beyond just a simple chuckle to a full on belly laugh. So much of drag is visual and Alaska understood that with her joke.</p><p>Whether or not she was genuine with her sentiment is not at all important for her joke. She shows her comedic power by staying in character and delivering a classic burn. By having a prop on hand showed that she was prepared for the moment.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/RuPaul-Alaska-.jpg\" /></figure><p>Though few queens showed any propensity for the rap challenges that they competed in, a few had the wherewithal to write hilarious lyrics. Alaska's rap was memorable not only because it was funny but because it was filled with philosophical witticisms as well.</p><p>By expanding drag to encompass all of life, she not only delivers a funny lyric but makes a statement about life in general. Despite her ditzy character, Alaska frequently shows that she is one of the smartest queens on the show.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alyssa-Edwards-Drag-Race.jpg\" /></figure><p>When given the choice to roast their competition, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rupauls-drag-race-biggest-beefs-ranked/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">many of the queens took shots at Alyssa Edwards</a>. This was mostly her own fault as she made herself easily unlikable to her fellow competitors. While others kept their insults in general, Alaska wasn't afraid to get to the heart of the matter and deliver a stinging blow.</p><p>By targeting Edwards' insecurities, Alaska showed that she could really be fierce when given the chance. It was obvious to viewers that Alaska saved her harshest blows for those who she really didn't like.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/rupauls-drag-race-things-early-seasons-aged-poorly/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">10 Things About RuPaul's Drag Race That Have Aged Poorly</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 01:00:48 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 1, 0, 48, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/ru-pauls-drag-race-alaska-funniest-quotes/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Is Book Of Boba Fett Boring?

A <em>Mandalorian</em> post-credits scene set up Boba Fett's ongoing <em>Star Wars</em> journey. In the scene, the bounty hunter kills Bib Fortuna (Matthew Wood) to take\u00a0over Jabba the Hutt's old throne. Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen)\u00a0then takes her\u00a0place by his side.</p><p><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> changes the character's <em>Star Wars</em> story, demystifying the mysterious bounty hunter. Boba Fett reached surprising popularity following a relatively minor role in\u00a01980's\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-empire-strikes-back/\">The Empire Strikes Back</a>. </em>However, the bounty hunter\u00a0then made an embarrassing exit in 1983's<em>\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/return-of-the-jedi/\">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, falling into a Sarlacc pit and supposedly dying, doomed to get slowly digested for years. The creature even belches after consuming Boba Fett. Finally, however, <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-attack-clones-jango-retcons-better/\"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>\u00a0retcon</a>\u00a0Boba Fett's\u00a0abrupt exit, giving fans a story nearly four decades in the making.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-ship-slave-1-missing-location-where/\">Where's Slave-1 During The Book Of Boba Fett?</a></span></p><p>Though\u00a0many viewers\u00a0praise\u00a0the series, <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>\u00a0also has its detractors. Among the negative feedback,\u00a0fans\u00a0often\u00a0call the show boring, as it leans into several flashbacks involving Boba Fett's journey with the Tusken Raiders. Unfortunately, these flashbacks don't necessarily focus on\u00a0the storylines fans anticipated and often don't use dialogue. Whether or not the scenes are successful comes down to individual preference; however, the creators behind the show also\u00a0set up fans to expect surprises that never came to fruition. Still, the series\u00a0will have\u00a0plenty of opportunities to redeem itself.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Boba-Fett-and-Tusken-Raider-in-The-Book-of-Boba-Fett.jpg\" /></figure><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-wars-visions-boba-fett-temuera-morrison-back/\">Temuera Morrison's Boba Fett</a> series showcases the bounty hunter's <em>Star Wars</em> journey in both the past and the present. Through flashbacks, the series shows Boba Fett's adventures after surviving the Sarlacc pit and making it onto the sands of Tatooine.\u00a0Following the ordeal,\u00a0Jawas take his armor, and the Tusken Raiders capture him. However, Boba Fett eventually learns the Tusken Raiders' ways and becomes accepted as one of their own. In the present, the series showcases the bounty hunter's quest to take over Jabba the Hutt's throne and become the crime lord and Daimyo of Tatooine.</p><p>Flashbacks were always going to be a significant part of <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>. Fans have been captivated by <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-episode-1-unanswered-questions/\">questions surrounding Boba Fett</a> for years, and\u00a0the bounty hunter's mysterious reappearance in <em>The Mandalorian</em> just fueled those inquiries even more. Most importantly, fans wondered how the bounty hunter survived the Sarlacc and where he had been in the\u00a0years since his fall into the belly of the beast. <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> was finally a chance to give fans the answers they craved.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tusken-and-Temuera-Morrison-as-Boba-Fett.jpg\" /></figure><p>The problem with demystifying fan-favorite characters is that viewers might not like what they see. For example, Boba Fett was a badass bounty hunter who could seemingly take on any threat in style in fans' minds. Unfortunately for\u00a0viewers wanting an invincible bounty hunter, that's not what the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-star-wars-timeline-takes-place-when/\"><em>Boba Fett</em> flashbacks</a> show. Instead, <em>The\u00a0Book of Boba Fett</em>\u00a0reveals\u00a0a flawed, vulnerable character. The bounty hunter gets defeated by a Tusken Raider in one-on-one combat and\u00a0looks much more human than fans expect the legend to be.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-owen-beru-lars-kill-theory-support/\">Boba Fett Adds Fuel To Dark &amp;amp; Debunked Fan Theory</a></span></p><p>Additionally, the flashbacks focus on the wrong things. <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> handles its biggest questions in the first few minutes of the series. The opening scenes reveal how the bounty hunter survived the Sarlacc and what happened to him after making it out of the pit. With the questions out of the way, the flashbacks become less necessary. However, the series continues to return to them, showing Boba Fett learning the ways of the Tusken Raiders and using very little dialogue the entire time. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-easter-eggs-references-episode-2/\"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> episode 2</a>\u00a0ends with a long, dialogue-less sequence of Boba Fett carving a\u00a0Tusken Raider weapon, constantly looking at his new friends for approval, and performing a ritual with them. But fans haven't been waiting forty years to see Boba Fett carve a stick. Strangely,\u00a0the series lingers on\u00a0that moment but breezes past more\u00a0anticipated flashbacks, such as the Sarlacc survival.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Where-is-Slave-1-in-the-book-of-boba-fett-1.jpg\" /></figure><p>The backlash to the show primarily comes down to expectations. <em>The Mandalorian</em> post-credits scene and the series' trailers set up <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> to be about the bounty hunter becoming a crime lord. And fans were looking forward to significant\u00a0reveals in the show. In a previous interview,\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-episode-1-spoilers-robert-rodriguez/\"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>\u00a0co-showrunner\u00a0Robert Rodriguez</a>\u00a0said the trailers were\u00a0left vague to hide \"<em>big surprises</em>.\" Fans also expected to see Boba Fett's helmet, ship, and advanced weaponry. But that's not what the series has delivered thus far. Instead, the first two episodes spend most of the time looking back on Boba Fett's adventures with the Tusken Raiders. His iconic helmet is just an afterthought in the show.</p><p>Having a show that's slow and builds up isn't the problem.\u00a0Plenty of successful shows, including <em>Mad Men</em> and even <em>The Mandalorian</em>, take time to build stories.\u00a0But\u00a0they need to build towards something. Through two episodes, <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>\u00a0has no clear direction. For instance, the second episode ended with <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/boba-fett-tusken-raiders-life-save-reason/\">Boba Fett performing a ritual with the Tusken Raiders</a> in the desert after a lizard went up his nose and gave him a psychedelic experience. Though a lot is going\u00a0on in the final scenes, the series fails to show viewers why they should care.\u00a0Simply having\u00a0Boba Fett on screen isn't enough. Fans expected a much different\u00a0show from the post-credits scene and the trailers. Unfortunately, <em>The Book\u00a0of Boba Fett</em>\u00a0isn't the show\u00a0they're\u00a0looking for.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/book-of-boba-fett-synopsis.jpg\" /></figure><p><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>\u00a0needs a clearer direction. If the series had delivered multiple episodes of the bounty hunter trying to get out of the Sarlacc, <strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong> fans would've likely\u00a0eaten it up. After all, those\u00a0moments mean something to them. But scenes heavy\u00a0on branch carving sessions and\u00a0light on\u00a0dialogue\u00a0may\u00a0confuse fans.\u00a0With a clearer direction and a show that\u00a0delivers on the promises of the trailers,<em>\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-episode-1-reactions-disappointing-divisive/\">Book of Boba Fett</a></em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-episode-1-reactions-disappointing-divisive/\"> can quickly end\u00a0disappointment</a>\u00a0and boredom. After all, the character has built goodwill with fans for four decades.\u00a0It's not over for <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> quite yet.\u00a0But if the most exciting moment\u00a0continues to be\u00a0the scenes where Boba Fett\u00a0gets\u00a0slowly digested, the show has a problem.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">More:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-wars-boba-fett-sarlacc-beak-george-lucas-fix/\">Star Wars Hints At Fixing One Of George Lucas' Annoying Special Edition Changes</a></span></p><p><b><i>The Book of Boba Fett</i></b><i>\u00a0</i>streams Wednesdays on Disney+.</p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 01:00:41 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 1, 0, 41, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-story-boring-tusken-raiders-bad/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "10 Games That Suffered From Poor Launches | Screen Rant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "10 Games That Suffered From Poor Launches | Screen Rant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/games-suffered-poor-launches/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/games-suffered-poor-launches/", "authors": [{"name": "Dalton Norman"}], "author": "Dalton Norman", "author_detail": {"name": "Dalton Norman"}, "tags": [{"term": "Lists", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "A bad start can ruin a video game&#039;s reputation, and ten games in particular all suffered from these types of poor launches.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "A bad start can ruin a video game&#039;s reputation, and ten games in particular all suffered from these types of poor launches."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<p>First impressions are everything and they can usually make or break the success of a <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/video-games/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video game</a>.

Ironically,\u00a0mangaka\u00a0Yoshifumi Totsuka couldn't have written these chapters any other way because of how perfectly it aligned with the inherent attributes and power of the battle's hero, Fuuko Izumo.</p><p>Fuuko Izumo wields one of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/my-hero-academias-quirks-undead-unluck-manga-powers/\"><em>Undead Unluck's</em> eponymous powers</a>\u00a0but has always relied on the protection of her partner Undead Andy. As a result, she\u00a0doesn't her own - until now, when she had to battle against the Spring UMA. She was perfect for this confrontation because she wields Unluck, and the Spring UMA's abilities revolve around games of chance. The strength of Fuuko's Unluck also add another odd dynamic because the more she cares for the person who will get hit with her Unluck, the more powerful the unluck she can inflict on them. So as her anti-luck clashes against games where luck is ironically absent, her only move left was to learn more about her opponent to enhance her powers.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/my-hero-academia-reminded-fans-deku-ochako-flaw/\">My Hero Academia Just Reminded Fans of the Biggest Deku and Ochako Flaw</a></span></p><p>Readers of\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/naruto-undead-unluck-shadow-clones-disgusting/\"><em>Undead Unluck</em></a>\u00a0who don't enjoy game-based fights have been suffering in silence for 10 chapters since it became apparent in chapter 83 how the arc would unfold. It would have been more tolerable if Fuuko just had to beat the Spring UMA in one game, but there were many, and they had several rounds. In what made Fuuko's involvement even more necessary, one of the games involved making one of her friends into a\u00a0top to engage in a twisted\u00a0<em>Beyblade</em>, and she chose Isshin because she was somehow related to the Spring UMA. This was important since it would help Fuuko get to know Spring. As readers would soon learn, Isshin is a descendant of the first human whom the Spring UMA connected with. Their friendship meant more to Spring because it blossomed during a time when humans feared\u00a0him, for the season of spring is connected\u00a0to cherry blossoms that symbolize death. In a twist, Spring UMA would later cause the death of Isshin's descendant, something which had understandably haunted him for generations. While all of this tragic backstory was enough to get Fuuko to care for Spring, the end was especially poignant when Isshin reveals that she was named after cherry blossoms, proving that her family didn't hold a grudge. Everyone cried, then Spring died.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fuuko-undead-unluck-spring-uma.jpg\" /></figure><p>While one of the most emotional moments <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/undead-unlock-hero-origins-mha-shigaraki/\">in <em>Undead Unluck</em></a>, all of this passion\u00a0was buried beneath the interminable wave of games that plagued the whole battle even though they were a necessary part to further accent Fuuko's intrinsic connection to the entire conflict. Similarly, readers were lost for a majority of the arc's starting chapters with the sudden introduction of Isshin's character as they tried to understand why\u00a0she was important. Knowing her connection to Spring would have helped readers get more invested in the story, but <em>Undead Unluck</em>\u00a0obviously couldn't reveal everything at once because then Fuuko would have had enough\u00a0emotional details to kill the Spring UMA immediately. Fuuko needed to ironically take part in luck-free games to use her unluck powers.</p><p>Apart from building Fuuko's character, <em>Undead Unluck</em> has been leading to this moment since chapter 30. A few chapters before, Fuuko and Undead Andy joined a group known as the Union whose members\u00a0are forced to accept and complete quests from a sentient book named Apocalypse to avoid the world's destruction and to kill <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/vegeta-dragon-ball-undead-unluck-beerus-manga/\"><em><strong>Undead Unluck</strong></em>'s sadist and twisted God</a>. By chapter 30, Apocalypse truly fulfilled his name by opening all of the remaining quests: Taking down the Spring, Autumn, Summer, and Winter UMAs. Spring was the last one. This new chapter was a massive turning point for <strong><em>Undead Unluck\u00a0</em></strong>as it heralded the end of an era that began more than 60 chapters ago.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/best-manga-twists-2021-hero-academia-attack-titan/\">The Best Manga Twists of 2021</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 01:00:07 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 1, 0, 7, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/undead-unluck-best-worst-fight-beautiful-end/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "10 Best Oscar Isaac Movies, According To Letterboxd | ScreenRant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "10 Best Oscar Isaac Movies, According To Letterboxd | ScreenRant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/best-oscar-isaac-movies-according-to-letterboxd-rating/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/best-oscar-isaac-movies-according-to-letterboxd-rating/", "authors": [{"name": "Samantha Savery"}], "author": "Samantha Savery", "author_detail": {"name": "Samantha Savery"}, "tags": [{"term": "Lists", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "img": {"src": "https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spider-Verse-Oscar-Isaac-2099.jpg"}, "figure": "", "list-items": "", "summary": "Oscar Isaac has starred in a Star Wars trilogy and shown off his dramatic talents.

Legion's chaotic personality is also telegraphed in the full page spread by the idiosyncratic art of Bill Sienkiewicz, which presents a scattered and jumbled image for readers to contemplate until Legion's first full appearance in the next issue.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>New Mutants #18</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Demon-Bear.png\" /></figure><p><em>The New Mutants</em> #18 is arguably the most important issue in the history of the team.

This is not Lenovo\u2019s first fiddle with the secondary display idea considering\u00a0the second-gen ThinkBook Plus had a black-and-white E Ink display occupying the whole lid.\u00a0Not to mention,\u00a0Lenovo is not the only brand with such ambitions.</p><p>The Asus ZenBook Pro 15 has a secondary screen built right into the touchpad. The Asus ZenBook Duo 14 has a wide secondary screen sitting right above the keyboard deck, spanning from the left to the right edge. The company then took the idea and included it with the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo SE gaming laptop. HP also played with the concept with its OMEN X 2S that's targeted at gamers. Smartphone makers, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/samsung-multi-fold-phones-flex-s-flex-g-ces-2022/\">are going absolutely wild</a>\u00a0with playing with the number of displays and their form factors.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/lg-three-screen-laptop-patent/\">LG Is Designing A Weird Concept Laptop With Three Displays, Patent Suggests</a></span></p><p>The third-gen <a href=\"https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/small-and-medium-business-portfolio-new-generation-power-global-recovery/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ThinkBook Plus</a>\u00a0looks like a rather tall laptop from the outside, but things get a little crazy once the lid is opened.\u00a0There's a 17.3-inch 1440p (3072 x 1440 pixels) display with an extremely odd 21:10 ultra-wide aspect ratio. Lenovo appears to be chasing fans of ultra-wide monitors here, but unlike a <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/sceptre-c505-super-ultrawide-monitor-review-specs-price/\">fancy ultra-wide monitor</a>, a laptop needs to fit inside a bag and that might prove to be a problem with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3. While\u00a0a wide screen is great for running two-applications side by side, not all apps play well when scaled to an unusual aspect ratio. Plus, the industry is now chasing taller screens, with the likes of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-apple-macbook-air-challenger/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Surface Laptop 4</a>\u00a0leading the way.\u00a0The ThinkBook Gen 3 Plus starts at $1,399 and will go on sale in May.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-3.png\" /></figure><p>If it comes as a consolation, the screen refresh rate is 120Hz,\u00a0even though the peak brightness is a rather modest 400 nits. In comparison, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/apple-2021-macbook-pro-announce-specs-price/\">the new 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> can hit 1600 nits of peak brightness. Gazing down that abnormally wide screen leads users to a secondary display that looks more like a tablet randomly placed to the right of the keyboard. It is an 8-inch LCD screen with 800 x 1280 resolution and comes with stylus support, which means users can scribble notes and touch up images. It also turns into a giant calculator while working on a spreadsheet, and users can move some of their frequently used apps to the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3\u2019s secondary screen for quick access. However, there are a few caveats.</p><p>An app\u2019s toolbar can be dragged to the secondary screen to get more screen real estate, but the app\u00a0will need to support detachable toolbars in the first place. While using a communication app, a separate chat window can be opened on the tablet-like screen. So far,\u00a0it\u00a0has only been tested with Microsoft Teams, Skype, and Zoom. Support for Google Meet and Slack, two of the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/slack-dm-messages-anyone-connect-update-getting-started-how/\">most widely used apps</a> in their respective segments, are currently missing. A \u2018waterfall\u2019 feature extends a webpage from the main display to the secondary screen, as if the content is scrolling across a bent screen. It looks cool but, again, it has a very limited scope. Finally, the secondary display can be used to mirror a phone\u2019s screen, somewhat like the DeX tech available on Samsung phones. On the Lenovo <strong>laptop,</strong> however, it only works with a handful of Motorola phones.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/dell-xps-13-plus-gorgeous-laptop-design-touch-bar/\">Dell's XPS 13 Plus Is Gorgeous, And The Touch Bar Makes It Even Better</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/small-and-medium-business-portfolio-new-generation-power-global-recovery/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo</a></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:58:06 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 0, 58, 6, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-3-laptop-two-screens/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Minecraft's Frogs Can Eat Goats, Player Discovers | Screen Rant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Minecraft's Frogs Can Eat Goats, Player Discovers | Screen Rant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/minecraft-frog-eat-goat-update-discovery/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/minecraft-frog-eat-goat-update-discovery/", "authors": [{"name": "Blaise Deveney"}], "author": "Blaise Deveney", "author_detail": {"name": "Blaise Deveney"}, "tags": [{"term": "Game News", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Recently a Minecraft player discovered that frog can actually eat goats.

In spite of being more than a decade old, the renowned sandbox title has managed to stay relevant thanks to a continuous adaptation that allows players to push the in-game boundaries with their builds.</p><p>Minecraft's mobs are AI-driven entities exhibiting specific behaviors that can be found throughout the blocky landscapes. There are different categories of mobs designated by\u00a0how they react to the player and can range from passive even when attacked to aggressive at first sight. Both frogs and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-find-goat-horns-farming-guide/\">goats are more peaceful <em>Minecraft</em> mobs</a>\u00a0with goats normally being the more violent of the two when it comes to interacting with the player as well as other mobs. After a recent discovery, however, perhaps goats should be turning their aggression towards a significantly smaller entity.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-scary-elmo-build-sesame-street/\">Minecraft Player's Scary Elmo Build Is Tickle-Me Terrifying</a></span></p><p>Reddit user\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/rxfovt/the_frogs_can_eat_goats/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JamesLovesTV</a> posted a short video that demonstrates in the world of <em>Minecraft</em>, frogs are predators to goats. In the clip, the player manually spawns in both mobs only to see the frogs not only devour the goats as soon as they are in range but actively chase after them if they are not.\u00a0Many of the commenters seemed fascinated by this discovery and were curious to see just where the boundaries of this frog-feeding frenzy ends.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, frogs and goats rarely interact with one another in <em>Minecraft</em>. Without the assistance of manual spawns, the surprisingly hungry amphibians naturally appear in swamp areas that are usually in flat lowlands that can sometimes even go below sea-level. Goats on the other hand can naturally be found in high altitude areas such as frozen peaks, jagged peaks, or snowy slopes. With <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/minecraft-video-biome-changed-update/\">such drastically different <em>Minecraft</em> biomes</a> causing these natural spawns, it would make sense that this strange gameplay element has gone largely unnoticed for so long.</p><p>While in real life frogs are generally known to eat anything that can fit in their mouths, the game's\u00a0developers have seemingly taken that mentality a step further.\u00a0With this new discovery, it is only natural to wonder just what is the biggest mob\u00a0those blocky amphibians can eat. The comments\u00a0to\u00a0JamesLovesTV's post already posed some potential tests so it is possible that more information could become known soon.

His adoptive parents are found out to work as freelance henchmen, fitting for the city known to have a crime problem. After a mysterious figure who has a pig invites Marcus to come through a curtain of water, there is a revelation concerning his <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/monkey-prince-dc-comics-series-free-prologue/\"><span class=\"s1\">destiny as the Monkey Prince</span></a>.

As the DC Universe continues to expand, Marcus Sun\u2019s inclusion as the Monkey Prince signals an effort in diverse storytelling, featuring creative teams who have the opportunity to represent underrepresented people groups. Unlike many heroes in the DC Universe, Monkey Prince isn\u2019t intrinsically tied to other characters. Despite living in Gotham City, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/monkey-prince-dc-comics-new-hero-festival/\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Monkey Prince</strong> is his own hero</span></a>, greatly contrasting the local vigilantes of the Bat Family.

With such popularity, however, also comes enticement to monetize the game.

The horror genre is going through a great run and not just on the big screen but on TV as well, and the most popular TV series from this genre continues to be <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/ahs/\"><em>American Horror Story</em></a>, the anthology series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk and which premiered on FX in 2011.</p><p>Each season of <em>American Horror Story</em> addresses a different horror theme with different characters and events, though with time, it has built a unified universe. The first season, retroactively titled <em>Murder House</em>, was all about a haunted house and the ghosts living in it, and since then, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/american-horror-storys-complete-timeline-explained/\"><em>American Horror Story</em></a> has explored a variety of themes, creatures, and places \u2013 from aliens to circuses and even cults. <em>American Horror Story</em> now has 10 seasons in its bag, and its tenth season, titled <em>Double Feature</em>, was divided into two parts: <em>Red Tide</em> and <em>Death Valley</em>, with one set by the sea and the other by the sand. Of course, there was a lot of speculation on the themes for season 10, more so after the teasers and posters showed the return of aliens, but the best theory around this season was quickly debunked.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/american-horror-story-every-season-connection-explained/\">American Horror Story: Every Season\u2019s Connection Explained</a></span></p><p><em>Red Tide</em> is the half set by the sea, and it takes viewers to Provincetown, Massachusetts to follow writer Harry Gardner (Finn Wittrock), his wife Doris (Lily Rabe), and their daughter Alma (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). The town turns out to be plagued by pale creatures who feed on blood, and they transformed into these monsters after taking a black pill that would have enhanced their talents, but they didn\u2019t have any. Harry becomes addicted to the pills and Alma starts taking them as well, sending the Gardner family into a downward spiral of lies and death. Before the premiere of <em>Red Tide</em>, it was heavily theorized that, as it\u2019s the part of the season set by the sea, that it <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/american-horror-story-season-10-sirens-aliens-theory/\">was going to include sirens</a>, but that was quickly debunked \u2013 but it can be used in <em>American Horror Story</em> season 11.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/American-horror-story-sirens-Alien-Experiments.jpg\" /></figure><p>Sirens (not to be confused with mermaids) are creatures from Greek mythology said to lure nearby sailors with their music and singing voices to shipwreck on the coast of their island, so they are some of the most dangerous creatures you can encounter at the sea. The physical appearance of sirens has been described as a combination of women and birds in different forms, and not they not only have mesmerizing voices but are also believed to charm the winds so their targets won\u2019t escape. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/american-horror-story-red-tide-vampires-hotel-compare/\"><em>American Horror Story</em> decided to use vampires again</a> (as it had already done so in <em>Hotel</em>) in <em>Double Feature</em>/<em>Red Tide</em>, but season 11 can easily go for sirens as its main theme, more so as it was one of the top themes voted by the audience when Ryan Murphy ran a poll on potential themes on Twitter.</p><p><em>American Horror Story</em> has already been renewed for three more seasons, and there are still many horror themes that can be addressed in the series, but given the disappointment of <em>Red Tide</em> and the excitement around the possibility of sirens showing up, the best option for season 11 would definitely be those dangerous and mesmerizing sea creatures.

The famed animator, author, filmmaker, and manga artist has been delighting audiences for decades with his unique style and extensive imagination, attracting not just a Japanese fanbase, but a wide ranging and devoted following from around the globe.</p><p>Known today by many for <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/studio-ghibli-movies-ranked-worst-best/\">his work at Studio Ghibli</a>, Miyazaki had an extensive career working for the animation wing of iconic Japanese film studio, Toei, for over\u00a020 years. It was here that he gradually learned the ropes of the animation industry, dedicating himself to the craft until he was able to direct his first animated feature film, <em>The Castle of Cagliostro\u00a0</em>(aka <em>Lupin III: Cagliostro no Shiro</em>), in 1979. Though the film didn\u2019t initially make much of an impact upon its release, today it\u2019s gained a niche status, revered by anime fans globally. By 1985, Miyazaki had gained enough momentum in his career and was confident enough in his abilities to co-found Ghibli Studios alongside fellow director, Isao Takahata, and producer, Toshio Suzuki. The new studio was called Ghibli after the Italian word of the same name, which loosely translates to \u201chot desert wind.\u201d Miyazaki felt the name was a suitable choice for his new studio and the desire he had for it to blow a new wind throughout animation.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/hayao-miyazaki-nausicaa-manga-masterpiece/\">Hayao Miyazaki's True Masterpiece Isn't His Films, It's His Manga</a></span></p><p>After many years being an award-winning industry leader in Japanese animation, Miyazaki has reached a new milestone in his eventful life, by celebrating his 81st\u00a0birthday. To help offer all the best to the beloved filmmaker as well as commemorate some of the vast body of work he\u2019s accomplished over the years, <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickAnimation/status/1478733720848945157?s=20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nickelodeon Animation</a></em> has released a mashup of some of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/avatar-last-airbender-studio-ghibli-fan-art-image/\">Miyazaki\u2019s most endearing characters</a> via their official Twitter account. The images are a testament to the filmmaker\u2019s extensive work and creativity over the years, and fans are sure to find naming every reference in the image to be a decent challenge. Check it out below:</p><p>The images range from easy to spot, like the Catbus from <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> and Robot from <i>Castle in the Sky</i>, for example, to slightly more challenging characters that only the biggest and most dedicated Miyazaki fans will know. All together, it\u2019s an impressive collection of creativity from the wonderful mind of a true animation legend. At 81, Miyazaki seems to have found a new lease on life and his career, returning to animated films in 2016 despite having previously announced his retirement in 2013. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/hayao-miyazaki-studio-ghibli-last-movie-details/\">His latest work as director and writer will be <em>How Do You Live?</em></a> a film that focuses on the psychological growth of a teenage boy.</p><p>While many actors and filmmakers find that their later years are reserved for taking some time to themselves and their families, Miyazaki has never truly managed to step away from <b>Studio Ghibli</b>. This is certainly a blessing for fans, who simply can\u2019t get enough of his quirky and at times mind-bending style and creativity, and having dedicated the bulk of his life to bringing animated projects to life, it\u2019s easy to see why Miyazaki\u2019s talents will live on for decades to come.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/from-up-poppy-hill-watch-online-netflix/\">Where To Watch From Up On Poppy Hill Online (Netflix, Hulu Or Prime)</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickAnimation/status/1478733720848945157?s=20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nickelodeon Animation</a></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:32:16 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 0, 32, 16, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-birthday-mashup-nickelodeon-video/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Why Witcher Season 2 Killed Its Best Love Triangle Solution", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Why Witcher Season 2 Killed Its Best Love Triangle Solution"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/witcher-season-2-love-triangle-triss-eskel-killed/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/witcher-season-2-love-triangle-triss-eskel-killed/", "authors": [{"name": "Craig Elvy"}], "author": "Craig Elvy", "author_detail": {"name": "Craig Elvy"}, "tags": [{"term": "SR Originals", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "The Witcher season 2 creates a love triangle between Geralt, Yennefer and Triss - but kills off a character that could&#039;ve resolved that tension.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "The Witcher season 2 creates a love triangle between Geralt, Yennefer and Triss - but kills off a character that could&#039;ve resolved that tension."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/the-witcher-season-2-love-triangle-geralt-triss-eskel.jpg\" /></figure><p>A perfect solution to <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-witcher/\"><strong><em>The Witcher</em></strong></a>'s big love triangle was staring viewers in the face - but season 2 killed off the all-important character who could've resolved the Triss tension. Where season 1 was all bathtubs, brothels and bards, Geralt of Rivia endures a more stressful time in\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-season-2-cast-character-guide/\"><em>The Witcher</em> season 2</a>, and few\u00a0moments cut him as deeply as the death of Eskel. A friend and fellow Witcher, Eskel reunites with Geralt\u00a0for their annual Kaer Morhen shindig, but arrives visibly distressed. Infected by a leshy, Eskel begins transforming into a violent wooden tree-beast, forcing Geralt to put him down with a heavy heart.</p><p>As if losing a friend wasn't bad enough, Henry Cavill's Geralt finds himself at the center of a love triangle in\u00a0<em>The Witcher</em> season 2. See, Geralt has fallen hard for Yennefer of Vengerberg - a sorceress he encountered off-and-on\u00a0throughout\u00a0<em>The Witcher</em> season 1. Though Yennefer reciprocates those feelings, fate seems determined to drive a wedge between them. While resting at Kaer Morhen, however, Geralt spends\u00a0some quality time with Triss Merigold - another of his magical contacts, and a friend to Yennefer. Triss tries putting the moves on Geralt one cold night at Witcher HQ, but gets firmly shut down\u00a0by\u00a0the white-haired warrior, whose heart belongs to Yen.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-ciri-mother-pavetta-alive-dead-duny-twist/\">So, What Happened To Ciri's Mother In The Witcher?</a></span></p><p><em>Witcher</em> fans\u00a0remain staunchly divided over whether Yennefer or Triss is Geralt of Rivia's perfect partner. For book readers, opinion skews definitively toward Yennefer, with precious little romance between the Witcher and Triss in Andrzej Sapkowski's narrative. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-season-2-triss-appearance-hair-change-reason/\">Triss Merigold enjoys more support among gamers</a>, however, serving as Geralt's main love interest for two whole entries in the CD Projekt Red series. Netflix brings that romantic dilemma to\u00a0live-action in\u00a0<em>The Witcher</em> season 2, and the troublesome triumvirate ends\u00a0on an ambiguous note. Geralt and Yennefer are\u00a0united come\u00a0<em>The Witcher</em>'s season 2 finale, but trust issues linger\u00a0from the whole \"kidnapping Ciri\" debacle. Meanwhile, a spurned Triss is gunning for the powerful Cintran princess herself, leaving the door open for a magic-fueled Geralt tug-of-war in\u00a0<em>The Witcher</em> season 3.\u00a0Alas, Eskel could've provided a solution to the love triangle madness... had Netflix's adaptation not killed him off so early.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Henry-Cavill-as-Geralt-and-Anna-Shaffer-as-Triss-in-The-Witcher.jpg\" /></figure><p>Despite playing a significant\u00a0role in\u00a0Sapkowski's books, Eskel is afforded but a single episode in\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/the-witcher-prequel-series-isnt-what-you-think-theory-explained/\"><em>The Witcher</em> season 2</a>, arriving at Kaer Morhen and perishing within a lone installment. Eskel's literary journey sees him forge a close bond with Triss Merigold, respecting her opinion and overcoming his initial mistrust to form keen friendship. Triss returns those sentiments by showing a special tender kindness toward Eskel. There's no explicit romantic connection (in canon terms, at least), but the\u00a0Triss-Eskel relationship is something Netflix's\u00a0<em>The Witcher</em> could've\u00a0nurtured into a proper love story, where Triss spends so long eyeing Geralt she doesn't notice her <em>true</em>\u00a0desires\u00a0right away.

And though an Eskel-Triss romantic pairing would represent a deviation from existing\u00a0<em>Witcher</em> canon, it's a much smaller leap than Eskel dying during his debut episode, which upset fans greatly.

These features are part of a bundle of services that Apple calls Continuity and they are really invaluable. In what might be a game-changing moment, Intel recently announced that some of these convenience features might be possible for Windows users by the end of the year when using a PC with Intel's Evo branding. In a YouTube <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9-OszrqDzjg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>, Intel demonstrated accessing iPhone messages on a Windows PC, noting that both texts and iMessages could be viewed and responded to, and that's just the beginning of this awesome new technology.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Classic-Apple-Ad-Im-A-Mac-Im-A-PC.jpg\" /></figure><p>Given the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/microsoft-beats-apple-most-valuable-company-oct-2021/\">long-standing rivalry between Apple and Microsoft</a> and the new challenge to Intel's chip dominance from Apple Silicon, it seems a bit unusual to see this type of integration. To be clear, there was no mention of Apple being involved in the development of what Intel is calling the '<em>Multidevice Experience</em>.' Instead, Intel is expanding the capabilities of apps developed by a recent acquisition of Screenovate. Working with Dell, Alienware, and LG, Screenovate developed apps that can be <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cancel-iphone-app-subscriptions-how/\">found in the iPhone App Store</a>\u00a0and ease communication between Apple's iPhone and the computers made by those companies. Screenovate's early\u00a0solutions mention accessing text messages but not iMessages, so this means Intel wants to take the integration to the next level.</p><p>Intel didn't hesitate when mentioning that this technology would be available by year's end,\u00a0but there is a chance that Apple will resist since it takes away some of the incentive to stay with a Mac. On the other hand, Apple has been <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/2021-macbook-pro-power-efficient/\">hitting home runs with the Mac computers</a> introduced recently, so it might not perceive Intel's software bundle as a threat. It would be wonderful if the biggest tech companies could all work together to make life easier for users, but money is a driving force and barriers assist with brand loyalty. Even if there is a\u00a0struggle against <strong>Intel's</strong> plans, simply seeing what is possible could inspire customers or government regulators to pressure Apple into providing better compatibility with Windows.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/intel-12gen-mobile-processor-world-fastest/\">Intel's 12th Gen Mobile Processor Is World's Fastest, Beats Apple's M1 Max</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9-OszrqDzjg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Intel/YouTube</a></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:28:41 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 0, 28, 41, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/iphone-windows-pcs-imessage-integration-intel-ces-2022/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Killing Scarlet Witch Will Unleash An Even Bigger Marvel Monster", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Killing Scarlet Witch Will Unleash An Even Bigger Marvel Monster"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/scarlet-witch-monster-chthon-darkhold-marvel-comics/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/scarlet-witch-monster-chthon-darkhold-marvel-comics/", "authors": [{"name": "Liam McGuire"}], "author": "Liam McGuire", "author_detail": {"name": "Liam McGuire"}, "tags": [{"term": "Comics News", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Scarlet Witch absorbed the Darkhold meaning that she&#039;s now trapped one of the biggest monsters inside her own being.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Scarlet Witch absorbed the Darkhold meaning that she&#039;s now trapped one of the biggest monsters inside her own being."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Scarlet-Witch-Monster.jpg\" /></figure><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Warning!

Long before horror stories were told through the mediums of film or TV, or even before they were written down in books, horror tales were spread through word of mouth. These passed-around horror stories came to be called urban legends, and have since come to inspire so much of what the horror genre ultimately became.

The reason behind the move is the old stand-by of TV cancellation: the ratings just weren't good enough to justify making a season 5.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/channel-zero-pretzel-jack-jillian.jpg\" /></figure><p><em>Channel Zero</em>, despite its positive reviews, never saw its cult fanbase translate into high ratings. Season 1,\u00a0<em>Candle Cove</em>, was the highest-rated installment by far, but by the end of season 4, audience numbers had dropped by more than half. <em>Channel Zero</em> season 4, which featured <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/channel-zero-dream-door-show-pretzel-jack-explained/\">memorable monster Pretzel Jack</a>,\u00a0even saw Syfy try an experimental release strategy, airing the season in a traditional week-to-week manner, but also dropping all six episodes online simultaneously, Netflix-style. Neither approach drew the viewership Syfy wanted.</p><p>As nice as critical acclaim and a loyal following is, TV is a business at the end of the day, and when enough people aren't watching a show, there's no real incentive to keep it going. Sometimes low-rated but critically acclaimed shows will get stays of execution in the hopes they'll win Emmys and propel a viewership rise for the next season, but sadly, the Emmys rarely recognize horror content, much less horror as visceral and disturbing as <em>Channel Zero</em> could often be. After all, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/hannibal-season-4-plans-explained-bryan-fuller/\">Bryan Fuller's masterful <em>Hannibal</em></a> - which <em>Channel Zero</em> creator Nick Antosca also worked on - is arguably the most acclaimed horror show of the last decade, and it never won a single Emmy. In that light, it's not hard to see why Syfy canceled <strong><em>Channel Zero</em></strong>, even if its quality was high.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">More: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/channel-zero-candle-cove-tooth-fairy-explained/\">Channel Zero: Candle Cove's Tooth Fairy Monster Explained</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:10:04 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 0, 10, 4, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/channel-zero-season-5-cancelled-reason-ratings-explained/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "The Bachelor: Genevieve Parisi's Age, Instagram, Job, Hometown & More", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "The Bachelor: Genevieve Parisi's Age, Instagram, Job, Hometown & More"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/bachelor-genevieve-parisi-age-instagram-career-hometown-facts/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/bachelor-genevieve-parisi-age-instagram-career-hometown-facts/", "authors": [{"name": "Bernardo Sim"}], "author": "Bernardo Sim", "author_detail": {"name": "Bernardo Sim"}, "tags": [{"term": "Reality TV", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Everything to know about Genevieve Parisi from Clayton Echard&#039;s season of The Bachelor.

It's no secret that fans <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-clayton-echard-season-26-fan-reaction-excitement/\">weren't excited about watching Clayton Echard's season</a> despite various promotional materials attempting to frame him as an <em>\"underdog\"</em> who would be a great lead on the show. There's still an entire season to play out on ABC, but Clayton's stint as a lead has been just as boring as viewers feared it would be.</p><p>In any case, there is always hope that this cast of women can bring up the temperature of the season regardless of how Clayton does on the show. During the season 26 premiere, it was made clear that this cast has lots of potential fan-favorites for Bachelor Nation. However, that potential has yet to be explored over the course of the season. Now, fans are turning to social media to learn more about the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-clayton-echard-kiss-season-26-premiere-teddi/\">women wanting to fall in love with Clayton</a>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a class=\"bc-title-link\" href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-rachel-recchia-age-instagram-career-hometown-facts/\" title=\"The Bachelor: Rachel Recchia's Age, Instagram, Job, Hometown &amp; More\">The Bachelor: Rachel Recchia's Age, Instagram, Job, Hometown &amp; More</a></span></p><p>Genevieve Parisi is a 26-year-old bartender from Los Angeles, CA. According to her intro interview with <a href=\"https://www.dgepress.com/abc/shows/the-bachelor/bios/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ABC</a>, Genevieve loves to go fishing but hates public speaking. Her favorite celebrity couple is Hailey and Justin Bieber, so she hopes to find a similar relationship for herself. Genevieve thinks of herself as someone who is <em>\"ambitious, confident, and persistent,\"</em> and it is important for her partner to allow her to be an independent woman. Her ideal man is someone who is passionate and able to have meaningful conversations. Genevieve would also like to be with a man\u00a0who's close to his mother.</p><p>At this point, Genevieve is one of the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-clayton-echard-season-26-cast-instagram-list/\">most popular <em>Bachelor</em> season 26 contestants on Instagram</a>. She currently has over 50,000 followers on her IG page, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/genparisi/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@genparisi</a>, where she describes herself as a <em>\"small town girl living in Los Angeles.\"</em> Genevieve has lots of Instagram pictures enjoying the sun, having a good time with her friends, and posing fiercely for the camera. It's too early to tell if Clayton will have chemistry with Genevieve, but it's clear that Bachelor Nation is really enjoying her given how many followers she's already amassed. On social media, it is pretty clear that Genevieve has a great sense of humor based on the captions of the pictures she has shared.</p><p>Genevieve got a rose from Clayton at the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/bachelor-clayton-echard-season-26-episode-1-watch-recap/\">end of <em>The Bachelor</em> season 26 episode 1</a>, so she's off to a good start.

Warner Bros. and DC Films have been building their own superhero universe/multiverse for years, but not every movie has performed as expected, prompting them to make big changes. Among those was the development of movies separate from the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/dceu\">DC Extended Universe</a>, the first one being <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/joker/\"><em>Joker</em></a>, directed by Todd Phillips and starring <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/joker-movie-joaquin-phoenix-weight-loss-skinny-how/\">Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck</a>.</p><p><em>Joker</em> tells the story of Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who turns to a life of crime after being constantly rejected by society, unintentionally leading a violent revolution against the wealthy in a decaying 1980s Gotham City. <em>Joker</em> addressed themes like mental health, gun control, and the media\u2019s influence on society, giving it a much darker tone than other DC movies, and it also made way for a number of theories on what exactly happened in the movie, with many believing it was all <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/joker-joaquin-phoenix-arkham-asylum-theory/\">a story in Arthur\u2019s head</a> and the only scene set in reality was the final one, which sees him as a patient in Arkham State Hospital (or Arkham Asylum).</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/joker-2-batman-movie-villain-problem-burton-penguin-copy/\">Joker 2 Can Fix A Batman Movie Villain Problem (By Copying Burton's Penguin)</a></span></p><p>Arthur struggled with his mental health throughout his life, and he even had a neurological disorder that caused him to laugh at inappropriate times. Arthur depended on social services for medication, but funds were cut and he and many others were left without therapy and medication, which further led him into a downward spiral. At <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/joker-movie-ending-explained-real-imaginary/\">the end of <em>Joker</em></a>, Arthur was a patient at Arkham Asylum, and after laughing to himself and telling his psychiatrist that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t get it\u201d, he left the room and left a trail of bloody shoe prints. Now, a <em>Joker</em> sequel has been rumored to be in development for a while now, and if it\u2019s to happen, it can deliver on the best idea from Ben Affleck\u2019s planned Batman movie: an Arkham Asylum-centric story.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/joker-arthur-never-left-arkham-asylum.jpg\" /></figure><p>Before Matt Reeves took over <em>The Batman</em> with Robert Pattinson as the lead, Ben Affleck was going to direct and star in a Batman solo movie. The script for Affleck\u2019s movie was reportedly set in Arkham Asylum and addressed the theme of insanity, with some reporting that Deathstroke orchestrated a breakout to tire the Caped Crusader and make him vulnerable. This idea was left aside with all the changes <em>The Batman</em> went through, but <em>Joker 2</em> can deliver on it now that Arthur Fleck is in Arkham Asylum. <em>Joker 2</em> can have an Arkham Asylum-centric story that allows viewers to explore this place and meet some of its inmates, and it <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/joker-2-no-batman-rogues-gallery-villains-origin\">doesn\u2019t necessarily have to include Batman</a> to make it interesting. Following the style Phillips gave <em>Joker</em>, setting the sequel in Arkham Asylum can give the audience a sense of being trapped there too with many different rogues that would add to the chaos of Arthur Fleck \u2013 and it would be very interesting to see what kind of villains this decaying Gotham City has created.</p><p>The future of <em>Joker</em> continues to be a mystery, with conflicting reports coming out every once in a while but no confirmation from the studio on whether it will happen or not. Still, there\u2019s even the slightest possibility that it could happen, and the ending of the first movie makes way for interesting story opportunities,\u00a0so <strong><em>Joker 2</em></strong> could be the movie that finally gives DC Comics fans a live-action Arkham Asylum story.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/joker-2-sequel-not-new-dc-villain-movie/\">Why Joker 2 Might Happen Instead Of Another DC Villain Movie</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:00:43 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 7, 0, 0, 43, 4, 7, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/joker-2-arkham-asylum-dc-villains-batman-movie/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Does The Galaxy S21 FE Have Wireless Charging?

Looking back on the smartphone niche, it's interesting to see how things have changed. A few short years ago, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/why-apple-removed-the-headphone/\">people wouldn't buy a phone if it didn't have a headphone jack</a>. Today, it's a rare sight to find a handset that still has the port!

The ability to plop a phone down on a wireless charging stand/pad and have it refuel without plugging in any cables is a magical thing. While wireless charging was once reserved for only the most expensive handsets, it's now widely available on everything from top-tier flagships to mid-range devices. And thanks to innovations like MagSafe from Apple, it's\u00a0likely wireless charging will <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/iphone-reverse-wireless-charging-patent/\">only become more popular as the years go on</a>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/galaxy-s21-fe-have-headphone-jack-explained/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Does The Galaxy S21 FE Have A Headphone Jack?</a></span></p><p>So, how does the Galaxy S21 FE fit into this equation? Like <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s21-5g/galaxy-s21-fe-5g/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">all of Samsung's Galaxy S phone</a>s from the past few years, the S21 FE supports wireless charging. Simply place it on any Qi charger, and it'll start charging up in an instant. It doesn't come with a wireless charger in the box (or even a charging adapter, for that matter), but it'll work with any wireless\u00a0charger you already own or plan on buying.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/galaxy-s21-fe-samsung-logo.jpg\" /></figure><p>Having wireless charging is one thing, but how well does it actually work on the S21 FE? Like the regular Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S20 FE, the S21 FE supports wireless charging speeds up to 15W. That's good, but <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/google-pixel-6-wireless-charging-support-explained/\">it's also not the best currently out there</a>. For example, the Pixel 6 Pro and OnePlus 9 Pro\u00a0deliver 23W and 50W wireless charging, respectively. Folks who need to charge their S21 FE in a hurry will want to use a 25W wired charger, but if time isn't a major concern, those max 15W wireless speeds should be perfectly fine.</p><p>Furthermore, the S21 FE's wireless charging can be reversed to enable Wireless PowerShare. This allows users to place another device on the back of the S21 FE and use it as a wireless charger. Wireless PowerShare works best for smaller devices like earbuds and smartwatches, but it'll also charge another smartphone in a pinch.</p><p>And that's wireless charging on the Galaxy S21 FE. It doesn't break any new ground, but it has <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-specs-display-processor/\">the standard features expected of a phone of this caliber in 2022</a>. It supports wireless charging up to 15W, and has Wireless PowerShare to charge other gadgets at 4.5W speeds. If wireless charging capability is a must-have,\u00a0<strong>Samsung's\u00a0</strong>got you covered with the Galaxy S21 FE.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/galaxy-s21-fe-vs-galaxy-s20-fe-comparison-samsung/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy S21 FE Vs.

From the game's bloody beginnings, players can expect to see a fair share of both essential and non-essential characters meeting their demise during play.

However, some are written into the game's story and will happen no matter what choices players make.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-side-quests-skip-boring-bad-rewards/\">Witcher 3 Side Quests You Can Just Ignore</a></span></p><p>The deaths mentioned are not only sad because players have to say goodbye to the characters involved, but because of how well <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-side-quests-best-easy-miss/\"><em>The Witcher</em>\u00a0sets up stories and\u00a0side quests</a>. <em>The Witcher 3</em> has always been a testament to masterful storytelling through gaming, and it really drives that point home with the emotional reaction it elicits from players and how meaningful it can make characters.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Witcher-3-Heartbreaking-Deaths-The-Bloody-Baron-Anna-Strenger.jpg\" /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phillip Strenger, or otherwise known as the Bloody Baron, is one of the first characters that <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-wild-hunt-player-count-netflix/\">players will assist in <em>The Witcher 3</em></a>\u00a0on their quest to find Ciri and recover any information about her whereabouts. While the Baron has a well-deserved nickname and a laundry list of wrongdoings, he and his wife Anna\u2019s story is tragic from beginning to end. If players choose to release the spirit in the tree rather than killing it, the Baron\u2019s wife will be discovered in the form of a Water Hag. In a desperate attempt to cure her, players will need to investigate a series of dolls, one of which is connected to Anna. If players choose the wrong doll, Anna will burst into flames and die. Consumed by the grief of losing his wife, this will prompt the Baron to end his life the next time Geralt comes to see him.</span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Witcher-3-Heartbreaking-Deaths-Keira-Lambert.png\" /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another duo in <em>The Witcher 3</em> whose fates depend not only upon Geralt but also upon each other is the sorceress Keira Metz and fellow Witcher Lambert. Although players may have qualms with their rough personalities, their deaths are not only avoidable but heartbreaking if they happen. Early on in <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/keira-metz-romance-witcher-3-guide/\"><em>The Witcher 3</em>, players both romance Keira</a>\u00a0and be responsible for whether she lives\u00a0or dies. If she goes to Radovid she will be burned at the stake, but if players can convince her thoroughly and stay diplomatic she will head off to Kaer Morhen. If Keira dies and does not make it to the Witcher school to aid in the final fight, then she will not be able to save Lambert, and he will subsequently die.</span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Witcher-3-Heartbreaking-Deaths-Crach-An-Craite.jpg\" /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although unavoidable, it is still a tragedy when Crach An Craite dies in <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-best-side-quests-better-main-story/\"><em>The Witcher 3</em>'s main story</a>. Crach has a long history with central figures of the game as Yennefer\u2019s one-off flame and as Ciri\u2019s uncle and protector by blood-oath. Not only was he a strong-willed and fair leader to his people on Skellige, but also Geralt and Yennefer\u2019s eventual, safe recovery of Ciri during the second Northern War was in no small part thanks to Crach. His demise is ultimately at the hands of Eredin Br\u00e9acc Glas, the king of The Wild Hunt himself. Geralt arrives just in time to see that rather than uttering last words, Crach takes one final jab at Eredin in true Skelliger fashion before being struck down.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-what-happens-romance-both-triss-yennefer/\">The Witcher 3: What Happens If You Try To Romance Both Triss &amp; Yennefer</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Witcher-3-Heartbreaking-Deaths-Vernon-Roche.jpg\" /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vernon Roche, commander of the Blue Stripes and fierce Temerian patriot has been consistently helpful to <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-4-protagonist-not-geralt-ciri-vesemir-prequel/\">Geralt in the<em>\u00a0Witcher</em> games</a>, even going so far as to introduce himself as an old friend. Although most of the time he is stoic and expressionless, he is unwaveringly loyal and pays his debts whenever they are owed. His death is another avoidable one that depends entirely on where the player's loyalties lie. In the plot to assassinate King Radovid, Dijkstra will reveal his betrayal and corner Geralt, Roche, and Ves. Relying on the Witcher\u2019s neutrality, Dijkstra will try to persuade him to leave and if done, both Roche and Ves will be killed.</span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Witcher-3-Heartbreaking-Deaths-Vesemir.jpg\" /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considered by some to be one of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-geralt-vesemir-fan-art-capybaras/\">the oldest Witchers alive, Vesemir</a> acted as a parental figure to not only Geralt in his youth but subsequently Ciri when she was brought to Kaer Morhen. His dry wit and sage advice makes him a loveable character who is that much harder to lose. His death is, unfortunately, unavoidable, and no matter what path players take he will ultimately fall at the hands of Imlerith. During the Battle of Kaer Morhen, Vesemir will spend his final hours fending the Wild Hunt off from Ciri, putting himself directly in the line of danger to keep her safe. His last action is to use the Aard sign to push Ciri away before having his neck snapped by Imlerith. His funeral after the battle is bittersweet, and he is honored as a hero for being a crucial part in defeating the Wild Hunt.</span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Witcher-3-Heartbreaking-Deaths-Ciri.jpg\" /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ciri is possibly the most painful <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/death-march-difficulty-witcher-3-guide/\">death in <em>The Witcher 3</em></a>, if not for the fact that players spend a majority of the main story trying to find and protect her then for how endeared everyone in the game is to her. Players get to see the world through her perspective and play as her in brief spots throughout the game, showing the audience her earnest and honest nature. Her fate will ultimately be decided by how good of a surrogate father players choose to make Geralt. In the dialogue choices, if the witcher is understanding of her feelings and allows her to express them in a constructive way, then she will live. If players choose the harsher, less encouraging dialogue, then Ciri will lose confidence in herself in battle and will fall victim to the White Frost whilst defeating it. This also pushes Geralt to become consumed by grief, leaving his fate unknown after trying to recover Ciri\u2019s medallion from the last remaining Crone.</span></p><p>Whether these character deaths were particularly impactful to players or not, it shows how well <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-2-geralt-choices-change-story-how/\"><strong><em>The Witcher 3</em></strong>'s story choices</a>\u00a0set up a variety of genuine narratives outside of the main protagonist. Each character has reasons to be loved by players outside of their association with Geralt, giving their stories supplemental life and structure of their own. Although a lot of them fall into grey morality, they are still able to be cherished and mourned due to their complex design.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-most-terrifying-monsters-bosses-folklore-myth/\">Witcher 3's Most Terrifying Monsters &amp; Their Folkloric Inspirations</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 23:55:27 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 6, 23, 55, 27, 3, 6, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/witcher-3-character-deaths-lambert-keira-bloody-baron/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Hogwarts Legacy Leak Suggests Release Will Come Sooner Than Expected", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Hogwarts Legacy Leak Suggests Release Will Come Sooner Than Expected"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/hogwarts-legacy-leak-release-date-soon-harry-potter/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/hogwarts-legacy-leak-release-date-soon-harry-potter/", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas McNulty"}], "author": "Thomas McNulty", "author_detail": {"name": "Thomas McNulty"}, "tags": [{"term": "Game News", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "As gamers and Harry Potter fans clamor for news about Hogwarts Legacy, a notable leaker suggests that the open-world title will apparate soon.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "As gamers and Harry Potter fans clamor for news about Hogwarts Legacy, a notable leaker suggests that the open-world title will apparate soon."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Hogwarts-Legacy-will-feature-many-fantasic-beasts.jpg\" /></figure><p>An apparent leak suggests that\u00a0<strong><em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/hogwarts-legacy/\">Hogwarts Legacy</a></em></strong>, the upcoming open-world role-playing game based on the\u00a0<em>Harry Potter\u00a0</em>franchise, will be released sooner than fans expect.

While Image\u2019s union does not represent creators, it was nevertheless inspired by the long struggles undertaken by generations of creators seeking fair recognition and compensation for their work. Legendary artist Neal Adams was one such activist, and his crusade was carried on by future generations of writers and artists, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/frank-miller-first-batman-comic-christmas-story-dc/\">such as Frank Miller.</a> In 1991, a number of Marvel\u2019s top artists, including Todd McFarlane, Jim Lee, and Rob Liefeld, left high-profile projects to form Image Comics. Inspired by their predecessors, Image\u2019s founders saw an unfair system and decided to do something about it, creating a business model that allowed creators to retain creative control over their work and thus receive fair compensation. Last year, partially inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, workers at Image Comics decided to form the first-ever union for comic book staff workers, including positions such as Production Associates and sales staff.

This has led to speculation that <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/legends-of-tomorrow/\"><em>Legends of Tomorrow</em></a> will be coming to a close after the final six episodes of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-season-7-hiatus-return-date-when/\"><em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> season 7\u00a0return</a> following a mid-season hiatus\u00a0and that the rest of the Arrowverse series may be next on the chopping block.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/flash-show-barry-allen-speedster-powers-strengths-abilities/\">The Flash: How Powerful The Arrowverse's Barry Allen Is In Each Season</a></span></p><p>In spite of these reports and the news that <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cw-network-profits-warnermedia-details/\">The CW has never turned a profit</a> despite producing many popular series, including the various Arrowverse shows, there is little reason for\u00a0audiences to give in to feelings of doom and gloom. It is just as likely that some series might be moved to HBO Max in the wake of a CW collapse as\u00a0them being canceled outright. It is also worth noting that WarnerMedia has made a large investment in the DC Comics brand, with <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/dc-tv-shows-upcoming-2022/\">many DC Comics television series</a> in the works, so the fate of the Arrowverse might not be sealed. All things considered, there are three likely scenarios regarding the future of all of the Arrowverse series.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-Arrowverse-Justice-League-Martian-Manhunter-Batwoman-White-Canary-Supergirl-Superman-The-Flash-Black-Lightning.jpg\" /></figure><p>The worst-case scenario for Arrowverse fans would be for WarnerMedia or the new owners of The CW to decide to cut their losses and cancel all the Arrowverse series outright. Something similar happened with all of the shows inspired by DC Comics properties on the Fox network following Disney's purchase of Fox due to Disney also owning DC Comics' main competitor, Marvel Comics. <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/gotham/\">Gotham</a></em>, which was a big hit for Fox that ran for five seasons, was canceled in anticipation of the merger, and an effort to renew the fan-favorite <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/lucifer/\">Lucifer</a></em> series faltered in the wake of the merger before Netflix picked up the series for another three seasons, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/lucifer-characters-future-what-happened-good-bad/\">coming to a close with <em>Lucifer</em> season 6</a>.</p><p>This possibility seems unlikely, even in the face of rumors that <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> and <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/batwoman/\">Batwoman</a></em> might be\u00a0ending later this year. It seems especially absurd given the upcoming premieres of the new series <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/naomi/\">Naomi</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/superman-and-lois/\">Superman and Lois</a></em> season 2, which has been one of the network's biggest successes critically and commercially. While some of the lower-rated Arrowverse series might\u00a0be canceled because of the sale, a line-wide shutdown\u00a0seems implausible, as many series still retain tremendous growth potential and high value on the international market.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Superman-Naomi.jpg\" /></figure><p>The second and more likely scenario is that some, if not all, of the Arrowverse series might be moved to HBO Max. Apart from the Arrowverse shows already on The CW and Netflix's adaptation of <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-sandman/\">The Sandman</a></em>, every <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/hbo-max-dc-shows-upcoming-release-dates/\">upcoming live-action DC Comics' show</a> currently in production or pre-production is being made for the HBO Max streaming service. Given that, it would not be entirely unexpected for the various Arrowverse shows to make the jump to HBO Max, which had also considered producing some Arrowverse spin-off series, like <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/green-arrow-and-the-canaries/\">Green Arrow and the Canaries</a></em>\u00a0and <em>Painkiller </em>after The CW passed on picking them up.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/dc-comics-tv-shows-cancelled-almost-happened-plans-why/\">Every DC Comics TV Show That Almost Happened (&amp; Why They Didn't)</a></span></p><p>This seems to be the most likely scenario, given previous practices behind the scenes at WarnerMedia. When the short-lived DC Universe streaming service closed down, most of its original programming was moved to HBO Max. Strangely enough, the sole exception to this mass migration was <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/stargirl/\"><em>Stargirl</em></a>, which it was felt would be a better fit for The CW, which has always been more focused on youth-oriented programming aimed at teenagers and young adults. <em>Stargirl</em> season 2 proved to be a big hit for The CW and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/stargirl-season-3-updates-news-renewal-story-details/\"><em>Stargirl</em> season 3</a> is still scheduled to air on The CW sometime in 2022.</p><p>Another consideration may be which Arrowverse series already have deals in the works to be streamed on HBO Max after their seasons are broadcast on The CW. Currently, <em>Stargirl</em>, <em>Superman and Lois</em>, <em>Batwoman</em> and <em>Naomi </em>are licensed to HBO Max, whereas <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-flash/\">The Flash</a></em> and <em>Legends of Tomorrow </em>are still licensed\u00a0to Netflix, along with all of the other Arrowverse series that have already ended their runs. It's possible that WarnerMedia might choose to focus on promoting the newer series that already stream on HBO Max and close out those <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/netflix-best-shows-2021/\">shows currently streaming on Netflix</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Arrow-Constantine-and-Supernatural.jpg\" /></figure><p>The final possibility is that all this worrying is much ado about nothing and that whoever purchases The CW will wish to maintain the status quo. This scenario also seems unlikely, given the breaking news regarding how financially unsuccessful The CW Network has been since its foundation in 2006. Presumably, anyone who purchased The CW would be doing so with an eye on changing things to make more money in the future. Otherwise, there would be little point in purchasing the network in the first place.</p><p>However, just because changes are in the works at <b>The CW </b>does not necessarily\u00a0mean an end to the<b> Arrowverse</b>. When UPN and the WB network merged to form the CW, many programs made the jump and continued to run after the merger. This included the long-running <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/supernatural-season-15-sam-winchester-rowena-magic/\"><em>Supernatural</em>, which recently ended with season 15</a>\u00a0after starting out on the WB. If <em>Supernatural</em> could switch networks after its freshman season and go on to become one of the strongest mainstays of The CW lineup, there is nothing to stop the same from happening with <i>Naomi </i>and other shows<i>\u00a0</i>should\u00a0they make one giant leap from The CW to HBO Max.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">More:\u00a0</span><a class=\"bc-title-link\" href=\"https://screenrant.com/dc-tv-shows-upcoming-2022/\" title=\"Every DC TV Show Releasing In 2022\">Every DC TV Show Releasing In 2022</a></p>"}], "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 23:50:15 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 6, 23, 50, 15, 3, 6, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/arrowverse-cw-network-warnermedia-viacom-sale-impact-meaning/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Legacies: Landon Can Become Like Vampire Diaries' Bonnie (But Better)", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Legacies: Landon Can Become Like Vampire Diaries' Bonnie (But Better)"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/legacies-landon-limbo-guide-souls-bonnie-tvd-anchor/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/legacies-landon-limbo-guide-souls-bonnie-tvd-anchor/", "authors": [{"name": "Michael Shapiro"}], "author": "Michael Shapiro", "author_detail": {"name": "Michael Shapiro"}, "tags": [{"term": "SR Originals", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "In The Vampire Diaries, Bonnie was the Anchor who could bridge life and death.

The CW show continues the story of <em>The Vampire Diaries</em> and <em>The Originals</em> as the latest installment of a TV franchise full of Gen-Z vampires, witches, wizards, and werewolves. The descendants of history's biggest myths are trained to control their powers at the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted, where they also face off against\u00a0the more relatable problems of teenage life.</p><p>Even though <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/legacies-landon-deaths-how-explained/\">Landon Kirby was killed</a> by Hope Mikaelson in one of the most emotional moments of season 4, with <em>Legacies</em> it\u2019s never that simple. In season 4 episode 9 (\u201cI Can\u2019t Be the One to Stop You\u201d) Landon is still existing in Limbo, the space between the worlds of life and death. Dissatisfied with simply moving on to the next world, Landon has picked up the habit of helping other souls move on instead.\u00a0He acts as both guide and consultant to the newly dead so that they can get past the emotional blocks of the posthumous process. Thanks to Landon, they can get the closure they need to find peace as they pass on to the afterlife.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Related:\u00a0</span><a class=\"bc-title-link\" href=\"https://screenrant.com/legacies-hope-landon-sex-blood-dangerous-malivore-why/\" title=\"Legacies: Why Hope &amp; Landon Can't Ever Have Sex With Each Other\">Legacies: Why Hope &amp; Landon Can't Ever Have Sex With Each Other</a></p><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/legacies-landon-malivore-golem-phoenix-human-dna-what/\">Landon\u2019s new role</a> as death-whisperer on <em>Legacies </em>is similar to Bonnie\u2019s in <em>The Vampire Diaries</em>. In that series, there was a time during which Bonnie became the \u201canchor\u201d which held together\u00a0the\u00a0worlds of the living and the \u201cother side\u201d where dead supernatural beings reside. Every creature that died passed through Bonnie. Though she\u00a0helped creatures find peace, the process caused her pain. <em>Legacies</em> is giving Landon the same chance to be an anchor for\u00a0the dead and to do it in a better, painless way.</p><p><img alt=\"Legacies Finally Explained Landon's Situation, But Can He Escape His Fate? | Cinemablend\" class=\"n3VNCb\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWurCUGKtbqBmHefT6RFvc.jpg\" /></p><p>Landon, unlike Bonnie, has always toed the line between the living and the dead. As a half-human/half-phoenix, rising from the dead is literally in Landon's blood. While he may still be stuck as a spirit in limbo, Landon can't help rising from the metaphorical \"death\" of stagnation into the \"new life\" of\u00a0helping others.</p><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/legacies-hope-landon-relationship-growth-holding-back/\">Landon\u2019s journey</a> on <em>Legacies</em> has been a roller-coaster. He\u2019s always had a strange relationship with death. Now that he\u2019s dead, he seems to have found a groove that suits him. It\u2019s definitely a lot better than Bonnie\u2019s experience in <em>The Vampire Diaries</em>. Landon might find more peace moving on completely, but that\u2019s never really been his style. <strong><em>Legacies</em></strong> may have killed Landon off, but\u00a0he will always find a way to stay relevant.

In the world of\u00a0<em>One Piece</em>, Devil Fruits give superhuman powers to those who eat them, but it was considered impossible to eat more than one with the result being death. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-blackbeard-multiple-devil-fruits-theories/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blackbeard is the first man to wield multiple Devil Fruit</a> powers at once, having stolen the\u00a0<em>Gura Gura no Mi</em> from the body of Whitebeard in an undisclosed manner. In the statue, the black hole created by the\u00a0<em>Yami Yami</em>\u00a0<em>no Mi</em> is sucking in a group of Blackbeard's desperate opponents, while on the other side the\u00a0<em>Gura Gura no Mi'</em>\u00a0earthquakes are dispatching another enemy, creating cracks in the air that have been brilliantly rendered by the artist. In the back and at the base of the statue, the devastating effects of Blackbeard's powers are shown, with the raging seas assaulting the island that the Emperor has chosen as his residence.</p><p>Tsume Art is known for the quality of its products, but the level of detail on this statue is simply astounding, as it can be appreciated from <a href=\"https://www.tsume-art.com/blackbeard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the close-up photos on the company's website</a>. The bodies of the pirates absorbed by the black hole are distorted by the gravitational pull.

It's even possible that he will eventually work alongside Boba Fett if the two share a mutual respect that outweighs their differences. Beyond his appearance in\u00a0<em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> leaves the potential for the character to make a\u00a0number\u00a0of appearances in other\u00a0<em>Star Wars\u00a0</em>properties, the most notable being the\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/book-boba-fett-obi-wan-kenobi-tatooine-problem/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi\u00a0</em>series</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Book-Boba-Fett-Black-Krrsantan.jpg\" /></figure><p>As mentioned before, Black Krrsantan worked under Darth Vader for a time during the Original Trilogy era. This leaves the perfect opportunity for the character to feature as an antagonist in the\u00a0<em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> series should Vader choose him to hunt down his former master. It's already\u00a0canon that Krrsantan and Kenobi did, in fact, come into conflict with each other during the latter's exile on Tatooine. After acquiring Obi-Wan's journals following\u00a0<em>A New Hope</em>, Luke Skywalker learned that the Jedi engaged in a duel with the Wookie bounty hunter after Jabba the Hutt sent him to kill Kenobi and enforce his water tax on the Lars family, taking <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-wars-boba-fett-kill-owen-beru-lars-theory/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Star Wars</em>'\u00a0Owen Lars</a> as a hostage. In the ensuing altercation, Kenobi blinds Black Krrsantan in one eye. Even if Vader has nothing to do with the two coming into conflict, it's\u00a0certainly likely\u00a0that this particular encounter will be adapted into the\u00a0<em>Kenobi\u00a0</em>series,\u00a0leaving an optimistic prospect\u00a0for Krrsantan's future.</p><p>Overall, Black Krrsantan's addition in\u00a0<strong><em>The Book of Boba Fett\u00a0</em></strong>is a welcome sight for fans of the character as well as\u00a0<em>Star Wars\u00a0</em>as a whole. The idea of a character making the transition from comic to television leaves the franchise with exciting possibilities about who can appear next, such as the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-vader-doctor-aphra-betrayal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">well-loved character Doctor Aphra</a>.

After losing the championship title to Daniel at the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/karate-kid-movie-daniel-miyagi-tournament-win-cheat/\">All Valley Karate Tournament in <em>The Karate Kid</em></a>,\u00a0Johnny's life had been on a constant downward spiral. However, Johnny's luck began to change when he revived the Cobra Kai dojo in order to teach karate to the next generation. Upon hearing this news, Daniel used his stellar reputation to hinder\u00a0Cobra Kai from attaining the same level of prominence it once had in his childhood. Johnny and Daniel's clashing goals reignited their long-standing rivalry with bigger and heavier stakes.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cobra-kai-johnny-daniel-perfect-conflict-ross-rachel-friends/\">Macchio Is Right - Cobra Kai's Johnny vs Daniel Is Too Perfect To Solve</a></span></p><p>In anticipation of season 4, <em>Cobra Kai</em> fans\u00a0thoroughly analyzed each piece of promotional material to discover any hint of what was to come. One of these pieces was a scene from a trailer that showed Johnny and Daniel facing each other at the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cobra-kai-season-4-all-valley-tournament-important/\">All Valley Karate Tournament</a>. From this brief snippet, fans theorized that the All Valley would have a sensei match between Johnny and Daniel. However, fans were quick to realize this theory was just that upon <em>Cobra Kai's</em> release date. Though Johnny and Daniel did have a fight, their brawl had no connection to the scene in question. Ironically, the very scene\u00a0that initiated the theory about Johnny and Daniel having a rematch at the All Valley Karate Tournament, in fact, brought the two together. The setting that once pitted Johnny and Daniel against each other now symbolized their teamwork.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cobra-Kai-Johnny-Daniel-Reach-Out-Hand-Younger-Selves.jpg\" /></figure><p><em>Cobra Kai</em> was building up to this moment of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cobra-kai-daniel-johnny-dojos-team-up-good/\">unity between Johnny and Daniel\u00a0for four seasons</a>. In <em>Cobra Kai</em> season 1, Johnny and Daniel were actively antagonistic towards one another. Between defaced billboards and raised rent, the chances of reconciliation were quite low. Season 2 showed some progress as Johnny and Daniel temporarily shelved their hostilities towards one another to enjoy a double date. However, the peace quickly faded once Daniel learned that Johnny allowed\u00a0Daniel's daughter Sam LaRusso (Mary Mouser) to\u00a0rest at his place for the night at the request of Johnny's son Robby Keene (Tanner Buchanan). Nevertheless, hope was not lost. <em>Cobra Kai's</em> third season had Johnny and Daniel\u00a0meet at a Christmas party to finally resolve their ongoing conflict by putting the past behind them. Though the two opted to\u00a0go their separate ways, season 4's <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cobra-kai-kreese-terry-silver-better-daniel-johnny-military/\">John Kreese (Martin Kove) pushed Johnny and Daniel</a> to join forces. Throughout this latest season, Johnny and Daniel had to go beyond simply tolerating each other and learn to work together, subsequently ending the bitterness in their rivalry for good.</p><p>Though officially concluding one of the most iconic rivalries in cinema is bitter-sweet, this decision opens the door to plenty of possibilities in <em>Cobra Kai's</em> season 5. As fans eagerly await for future\u00a0<strong><em>Cobra Kai</em></strong> trailers to drop, they will certainly be\u00a0ready to\u00a0examine every detail and craft new theories. Whether or not these fan theories end up being debunked, their existence is able to bring a community together, much like Johnny and Daniel.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">More: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cobra-kai-season-4-ending-explained/\">Cobra Kai Season 4 Ending &amp; All Twists Explained</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 23:30:27 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 6, 23, 30, 27, 3, 6, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/cobra-kai-season-4-sensei-match-theory-wrong/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "The World's First 17-Inch Foldable Laptop By Asus Looks Gorgeous", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "The World's First 17-Inch Foldable Laptop By Asus Looks Gorgeous"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-foldable-laptop-gorgeous/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-foldable-laptop-gorgeous/", "authors": [{"name": "Shikhar Mehrotra"}], "author": "Shikhar Mehrotra", "author_detail": {"name": "Shikhar Mehrotra"}, "tags": [{"term": "Tech", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Asus launched the new Zenbook 17 Fold OLED at this year&#039;s CES event, an all-screen foldable laptop that&#039;s equipped with a 17-inch display.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Asus launched the new Zenbook 17 Fold OLED at this year&#039;s CES event, an all-screen foldable laptop that&#039;s equipped with a 17-inch display."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Asus-Zenbook-17-Fold-OLED.jpg\" /></figure><p><strong><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/Asus/\">Asus</a></strong> has stepped into the world of foldable devices by revealing the world's first 17-inch OLED laptop that folds in half. Many consumer tech companies such as Samsung, Microsoft, and Xiaomi are now putting a lot of time and effort into developing smart devices with a flexible display, but only Samsung seems to have cracked the code so far with its lineup of foldable smartphones like the\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/samsung-foldable-phones-sales-2021-comparison/\">Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>.</p><p>Previously, Lenovo launched the ThinkPad X1 Fold. The all-screen foldable laptop came with a 13.3-inch 2K display with a peak brightness of 300 nits. Under the hood, the device features an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM, and 512GB of storage, with the price of the ThinkPad X1 Fold starting at $2,499. However, the smaller display of the device\u00a0makes it feel more like a foldable tablet than a laptop. More recently, Lenovo\u00a0announced its new dual-screen ThinkBook Plus laptop.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/asus-rog-gaming-phone6-design/\">The Next Asus Gaming Phone Might Look Every Bit As Tacky As It Should\u00a0</a></span></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/Laptops/For-Home/Zenbook/Zenbook-17-Fold-OLED-UX9702/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zenbook 17 Fold OLED</a> is an all-screen foldable laptop by Asus that provides a 12.5-inch screen (3:2 aspect ratio) when folded and a 17.3-inch 2.5K color-accurate screen (4:3 aspect ratio) when unfolded. In its unfolded state, the device is a large touch-enabled OLED display\u00a0with a peak brightness of 500 nits and a 0.2 ms response time. The thin bezels, display quality, and foldable nature make the Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED a gorgeous device. According to Asus, the device can be used in multiple modes, including tablet mode, book mode, laptop mode (with an on-screen keyboard), and computer mode. For those interested, the ZenFold 17 Fold OLED will be available to purchase in the second quarter of 2022. In addition to the foldable laptop, Asus also revealed\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/asus-rog-flow-z13-laptop-tablet/\">the Asus ROG Flow Z13 tablet</a>\u00a0at this year's CES event.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Asus-Zenbook-17-Fold-OLED-laptop.jpg\" /></figure><p>Under the hood, the Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED is equipped with a 12th generation <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/intel-alder-lake-desktop-cpus-two-die-sizes-variants-revealed/\">Intel Core i7-1250U processor</a>, 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and 1TB of PCIe 4.0 SSD. For connectivity, the foldable laptop features two Thunderbolt 4 ports. Surprisingly, while other companies are removing the audio jack from their latest products, the Asus Zenbook 17 Fold features a 3.5mm audio jack. Asus is also providing the ErgoSense Bluetooth keyboard and touchpad along with the device. Thanks to the high-quality display and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/dolby-atmos-soundbar-cheaper/\">quad-speaker system that supports Dolby Atmos</a>,\u00a0the Zenbook 17 Fold should provide an excellent multimedia experience.</p><p>As far as the durability of the product is concerned, Asus says that it has tested the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED's hinge for 30,000\u00a0cycles. On average, if the laptop is folded and reopened ten times a day, the hinge should work fine for more than a few years. While the company has not announced the price, the <strong>Asus</strong> Zenbook 17 Fold OLED is a premium product, and that likely means it will come with a premium price tag as well.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/asus-purego-produce-gadget/\">ASUS, The Computer Company, Made A Gadget That Scans Veggies For Chemicals</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/Laptops/For-Home/Zenbook/Zenbook-17-Fold-OLED-UX9702/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Asus</a></p>"}], "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 23:28:30 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 6, 23, 28, 30, 3, 6, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-foldable-laptop-gorgeous/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Star Trek Picard Production Shut Down After 50+ Test Positive For COVID", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Star Trek Picard Production Shut Down After 50+ Test Positive For COVID"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/star-trek-picard-production-shut-down-covid-details/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/star-trek-picard-production-shut-down-covid-details/", "authors": [{"name": "Rachel Labonte"}], "author": "Rachel Labonte", "author_detail": {"name": "Rachel Labonte"}, "tags": [{"term": "TV News", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Paramount+&#039;s Star Trek: Picard has slowed to a stop for the week as more than 50 members of its cast and crew test positive for COVID.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Paramount+&#039;s Star Trek: Picard has slowed to a stop for the week as more than 50 members of its cast and crew test positive for COVID."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Star-Trek-Picard-season-2-Patrick-Stewart.jpg\" /></figure><p>Paramount+'s\u00a0<strong><em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/star-trek-picard/\">Star Trek: Picard</a></em></strong><em>\u00a0</em>has become one of the latest shows to halt production due to coronavirus as 50+ test positive. The current surge of COVID cases caused by the Omicron variant has presented new challenges for the entertainment industry as awards shows, film festivals, and productions have been hit in different ways. The <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/grammy-awards-2022-ceremony-postponed-why-details/\">Grammys were recently postponed</a>, and television shows like\u00a0<em>NCIS</em> and\u00a0<em>Grey's Anatomy</em> have paused\u00a0filming out of concern over the rising numbers. Meanwhile, there's been increased worry over how the box office can handle these renewed issues.</p><p>In the case of\u00a0<em>Star Trek: Picard,</em> the Patrick Stewart-led streaming series has already been affected by the pandemic. The first season premiered just ahead of the crisis' onset, but filming on season 2 was delayed considerably. Originally planned to take place in 2020,\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-trek-picard-season-2-riker-q-scene/\"><em>Picard</em> season 2</a> held off on starting production until the following year.

Per\u00a0<em>THR</em>, filming on the series has been shut down since Monday because of a sizable outbreak. More than 50 members of the production across several areas (including the cast) have tested positive for COVID. Sources say filming could pick up again early next week, but details are in limbo. CBS Studios did not comment on the matter.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Picard-Team-and-Plan-in-Season-2.jpg\" /></figure><p>Assuming all those who have tested positive complete their necessary quarantines and no new cases emerge, <em>Star Trek: Picard\u00a0</em>should have no issues getting back on track. However, it's hard to predict these situations, and it would be smarter for CBS Studios to be cautious when navigating this. While it's true that a number of productions have halted work amid the new surge, not all of them have been for positive cases;\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/greys-anatomy-season-18-abc-production-shut-down-details/\"><em>Grey's Anatomy</em> and fellow ABC shows</a>\u00a0<em>Station 19</em> and\u00a0<em>The Rookie</em> were paused out of an abundance of caution.\u00a0<em>Star Trek: Picard</em> has an outbreak to contend with, and the safety of those working on the show should be put first.</p><p>The bright side of this is that\u00a0<em>Star Trek: Picard\u00a0</em>season 2 should still be okay to debut sometime in February. Paramount+ hasn't scheduled a concrete date for its return, but the streamer is also set to release the back half of\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-trek-discovery-season-4-insurrection-movie-redeem-better/\"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> season 4</a> within that month as well. Provided\u00a0<em>Picard</em>'s shutdown doesn't stretch on for too long, Paramount+ should have no reason to push back season 2's premiere.

One stand-out weapon has been\u00a0<em>Vanguard's</em>\u00a0Volk\u00a0assault rifle.<em>\u00a0</em>The Volk acts more like an SMG and can dominate enemy squads at close- to medium-range. The Volk fits perfectly in a sniper combo, so players should consider choosing one of\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/warzone-pacific-caldera-best-snipers-attachments-guide/\"><em>Warzone's\u00a0</em>best snipers\u00a0like the Kar98k</a>.</p><p>If players want the Volk to be effective in <em>Warzone</em>, they\u00a0will need to unlock all its attachments too.

Its high damage output and high fire rate will have the weapon outgunning most SMGs at close range while maintaining the upper hand at medium range due to its assault rifle nature. The Volk's impact and fire rate also cause heavy recoil, which players will feel while using the Volk at long ranges. However,\u00a0that is what the Kar98k or other sniper rifle is for.

The Burton-Keaton partnership was usurped by Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer in 1995, but a sojourn with George Clooney's Batman prompted yet another franchise reboot. Christopher Nolan then found great success directing Christian Bale in the\u00a0<em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy, but Ben Affleck's DCEU incarnation endured\u00a0more mixed fortunes.</p><p>Carrying the Batman mantle into 2022 is Robert Pattinson... and Michael Keaton... and Ben Affleck.

The director's natural affinity for all things\u00a0shadowy and spooky perfectly suited Bruce Wayne's 1980s comic book antics, which included\u00a0Alan Moore's seminal\u00a0<em>The Killing Joke</em> - a graphic novel that greatly influenced Michael Keaton's\u00a0<em>Batman</em>\u00a0debut. Burton plumbed even darker depths for\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/batman-returns/\"><em>Batman Returns</em></a> in 1992, which incorporated more of the offbeat, gothic, horror-tinged elements found throughout Kooky Tim's filmography.</p><p><em>Batman Returns</em>' grim tone vexed Warner Bros. greatly.

In doing so, the studio grossly misunderstood Batman's character and his comic book appeal. Superman is DC's clean-cut role model; Batman is the morally-ambiguous rebel. And despite\u00a0<em>Batman Returns</em> taking a box office hit, Burton's sequel still became the third highest-grossing domestic release of 1992, suggesting Ronald McDonald wasn't the only contributing factor.

Joel Schumacher's DC debut isn't\u00a0<em>really</em> as sanitized as some suggest. Robin still pummels Two-Face\u00a0in revenge for the Flying Graysons' circus deaths, Riddler throws his boss out a window, and Val Kilmer doesn't\u00a0<em>completely</em> shed Keaton's \"tortured hero\" vibe.</p><p>But where\u00a0<em>Batman Forever</em> has its merits,\u00a0<em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> does not. Bordering on farce, the sugary\u00a0tone of\u00a0<em>Batman Forever</em> was amplified to tasteless heights, and George Clooney's casting typified how Warner Bros. was prioritizing\u00a0<em>Batman</em>'s \"brand\"\u00a0over picking a suitable actor. With\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/batman-forever-deleted-cut-scenes/\"><em>Batman Forever</em>, Joel Schumacher</a> made a\u00a0<em>Batman</em> movie for a young audience; in\u00a0<em>Batman &amp; Robin</em>, he made a film that insulted even the youngest\u00a0Caped Crusader fan's intelligence. Underpinning that failure was the mistaken belief that Batman is\u00a0a glorified mascot,\u00a0never to be confused for\u00a0grown-up cinema.\u00a0<em>Batman &amp; Robin</em>'s across-the-board failure proved the \"dumbing-down\" philosophy that defined Schumacher's movies wouldn't necessarily correlate\u00a0with\u00a0higher box office.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Robert-Pattinson-in-The-Batman.jpg\" /></figure><p>Lessons were quickly learned after\u00a0<em>Batman &amp; Robin</em>. Warner Bros. allowed Christopher Nolan to\u00a0make his pitch-black\u00a0<em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy, and everyone benefited. Box office, reviews, and audience reaction were all overwhelmingly positive, despite Christian Bale representing the absolute antithesis of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/batman-movie-actors-quit-left-reason/\">Val Kilmer and George Clooney</a>. History sort-of repeated itself in the mid-2010s, however, when Zack Snyder's \"too dark\"\u00a0<em>Batman V Superman</em> infamously led to Warner Bros. asking if Joss Whedon\u00a0would mind lightening up\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/justice-league/\">Justice League</a></em>.

Robert Pattinson's Bruce Wayne is borderline-obsessed as Gotham City's newfound vigilante, at odds with even his faithful butler, Alfred. Stalking the streets when darkness falls,\u00a0<em>The Batman</em>'s titular hero proudly proclaims, \"<em>I am vengeance</em>\" as he punches a hapless thug to within an inch of his life,\u00a0then\u00a0electrocutes another with a taser.

And yet\u00a0fans and critics across the land\u00a0are proclaiming Robert Pattinson's DC debut as 2022's most exciting movie release. That's partly down to a shift in audience tastes and societal boundaries, but unlike\u00a0<em>Batman Returns</em>, where family audiences were\u00a0shocked at how sinister Tim Burton's sequel could be,\u00a0an overwhelmingly dark tone is one of\u00a0<em>The Batman</em>'s foremost selling points.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Michael-keaton-ben-affleck-batman-batman-vs-superman-.jpg\" /></figure><p>With Robert Pattinson's Kurt-Cobain-meets-Punisher interpretation of Batman on the horizon, Warner Bros. might've been tempted to steer 2022's remaining cinematic Caped Crusaders into lighter territory.\u00a0That doesn't appear to be the case.</p><p>Working on\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/michael-keaton-batman-batgirl-dceu-reboot-theory/\"><em>The Flash</em>, Michael Keaton</a> has spoken highly of how Andy Muschietti (director) is honoring Tim Burton's vision and aesthetic. A full 30 years after Warner Bros. asked him to make way for Joel Schumacher, that's surely some kind of vindication for Burton's\u00a0<em>Batman</em> movies and the darkness woven through them.

Zendaya made her MCU debut alongside Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-Man in 2017's <em>Spider-Man:\u00a0Homecoming</em>, a film that saw her play Michelle, a sarcastic/guarded student who would rather mock her classmates than become a social butterfly. At the end of the film, it was revealed that Michelle Jones is the MJ to the MCU\u2019s Peter Parker. After developing that iconic relationship in <em>Spider-Man:</em>\u00a0<em>Far From Home </em>two years later,\u00a0MJ returned in <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-box-office-us-total/\"><em>Spider-Man:\u00a0No Way Home</em>, the biggest film</a> of the past year.</p><p>In\u00a0<em>Far From Home</em>\u2019s credits scene, Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) implicated Spider-Man as a murderer and revealed his secret identity to the world. Picking up where that left off,\u00a0<em>No Way Home\u00a0</em>begins with Peter and MJ fleeing Times Square. The beginning of the film deals with how Peter, as a divisive figure, affects the lives of his family and friends. Ultimately, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. Unfortunately, the pair end up cracking open the multiverse and bringing back former Spidey villains Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Electro (Jamie Foxx), Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-trailer-lizard-cast-reaction/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">and Lizard (Rhys Ifans)</a>. Thankfully, Peter remedies this situation and overcomes tragedy with the help of some familiar webslingers, his friend Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) and, of course, MJ.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-aunt-may-death-fixed-point/\">Why No Way Home's Big Death Can Never Be Undone</a></span></p><p>In an interview with\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/tom-holland-zendaya-spider-man-no-way-home-love-loss\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marvel.com</a></em>, Zendaya spoke on how, in the first couple of <em>Spider-Man</em> movies, MJ is very much a loner. When Peter comes along, she becomes less and less so. Then, in\u00a0<em>No Way Home</em>, MJ even becomes a much more positive and <em>\"confident\"</em> person, just like Peter. Read what Zendaya had to say about this role reversal below:</p><blockquote><p>\"Peter helps to melt MJ a little bit and break the shell that she's had to build in order to protect herself from the world. She doesn't have many people she feels that she can trust and rely on, and Peter has now become one of those people. And she doesn't want to lose him \u2026 She doesn't want to lose this person that really has allowed her to feel more and more like herself, and more and more confident in who she is, and loves her exactly for all the quirks and things that make her who she is. Because he's going through so much, she now takes on his positivity that maybe he's losing a little bit. He takes on a more negative nihilistic outlook.\"</p></blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zendaya-as-MJ-in-Spider-Man-No-Way-Home.jpg\" /></figure><p>The character arc that Zendaya points out is clearly evident by the end of <em>Spider-Man:</em> <em>No Way Home</em>. While discussing college applications near the beginning of the film, MJ tells Peter, <em>\u201cIf\u00a0you expect disappointment, then you can never really be disappointed</em>.\u201d When she and her friends don\u2019t get into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00a0(MIT), Peter goes to Strange and multiversal madness ensues. In the movie\u2019s climax, Peter realizes the only way to protect the multiverse is for <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/spiderman-peter-identity-mj-promise-no-way-home/\">Strange to erase \u201cPeter Parker\u201d</a> from everyone\u2019s memory, and then promises MJ and Ned he will find them after and remind them who he is. At the end of the film, Peter goes to the donut shop where MJ works and finds her and Ned have gotten into MIT. After revisiting MJ\u2019s quote from earlier in the film,\u00a0this time MJ chooses\u00a0optimism, saying,\u00a0<em>\u201csomething feels different this time,\u201d\u00a0</em>which factors into Peter\u2019s decision\u00a0to break his promise.</p><p>On top of making Zendaya\u2019s MJ a more prominent and more nuanced character than in previous <em>Spider-Man</em> films, <em><strong>Spider-Man:</strong></em>\u00a0<strong><em>No Way Home\u00a0</em></strong>gives her a <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-mj-watson-retcon-mistake/\">comic-accurate-esque name in Michelle Jones-Watson</a>. It remains to be seen\u00a0whether\u00a0Zendaya's MJ\u00a0will seen again in the MCU, but recent reports suggest Disney/Marvel Studios and Sony are actively developing future films with Holland\u2019s webslinger.

Development on an adaptation of the adventure game series has been in the works for nearly 15 years with a number of writers, directors and stars coming and going as no one take could be agreed upon between Sony and the various creatives involved.

While reflecting on the project's long development cycle, the director cited his long-standing relationship with Sony as a key factor for allowing him to land and keep the job following the back-to-back success of\u00a0<em>Venom\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Zombieland</em>. See what Fleischer said below:</p><blockquote><p><em>\"I was firing on all cylinders from a production standpoint.\u00a0I was just really in the rhythm of making movies.\"</em></p></blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-7.06.54-PM-1.jpg\" /></figure><p>The development cycle of\u00a0<em>Uncharted\u00a0</em>was certainly a problematic one, with the project having gone through six directors including David O. Russell, Neil Burger, Seth Gordon, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/uncharted-movie-director-exit-shawn-levy/\">Shawn Levy</a>, Dan Trachtenberg and Travis Knight before landing on Fleischer to helm. As the ultimate filmmaker states in his interview, he does have a solid relationship with Sony that goes back to his feature directorial debut with 2009's\u00a0<em>Zombieland</em>, which he would subsequently follow up with the modestly successful action comedy\u00a0<em>30 Minutes or Less</em>. After initially trying his hand with Warner Bros. for\u00a0the similarly modest hit\u00a0<em>Gangster\u00a0</em><em>Squad</em>, Fleischer would return to Sony for\u00a0<em>Venom</em>.</p><p>Those familiar with Fleischer's filmography may have some skepticism going into\u00a0the\u00a0<em><strong>Uncharted\u00a0</strong></em>movie adaptation given the range of reviews his films have received over the years. However, Sony's decision to keep him in the director's chair after going through so many other properties makes sense given the financial success he's brought to the studio in recent years with the fan-favorite\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/uncharted-movie-tom-holland-director-venom-zombieland-rumors/\"><em>Venom\u00a0</em>in 2018 and the well-received\u00a0<em>Zombieland: Double Tap</em></a>.

Emmerich has much experience with both science-fiction and disaster movies - his career, which began in Hollywood in 1992, saw him directing the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/stargate-movie-reboot-roland-emmerich-not-involved/\">science-fiction blockbusters\u00a0<em>Stargate</em></a>\u00a0and<em> Independence Day\u00a0</em>among others, and his films often feature large-scale disasters like the global flood featured in his film\u00a0<em>2012</em>.</p><p>Emmerich's new film\u00a0<em>Moonfall,\u00a0</em>which he co-wrote and directed, promises to maintain the director's particular style. The film's official website reveals that\u00a0<em>Moonfall\u00a0</em>tells the story of NASA executive Jo Fowler (Halle Berry) as she races to stop the moon's collision with Earth while working with former astronaut Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson) and conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman (John Bradley). In the process, the three discover that the moon is \"<em>not what\u00a0[they]\u00a0think it is.</em>\"\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/moonfall-movie-trailer-halle-berry-fake-moon-disaster/\"><em>Moonfall</em>'s trailer shows that not only will the film</a> feature the massive destruction Emmerich is known for but also a sentient alien enemy for the heroes to face in space.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/moonfall-disaster-movie-roland-emmerich-independence-day-2/\">Moonfall Can Redeem Roland Emmerich After Independence Day 2 Disaster</a></span></p><p>In anticipation of his film, Emmerich\u00a0discusses\u00a0<em>Moonfall</em>'s trailer and explains some of the ideas behind the film with <em><a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/roland-emmerich-moonfall-trailer/?utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_entertainmentweekly&amp;utm_content=new&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_term=61d71336df9b5d0001e3765e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EW</a></em>. During this discussion, Emmerich credits\u00a0<em>Who Built the Moon? </em>as the source for the concept of a fake moon.\u00a0The book written by Christopher Knight and Alan Butler explores the\u00a0mysteries of the moon through geometry, astrophysics, and history. Emmerich says reading this book gave him the idea that the moon is \"<em>built rather than natural.</em>\"\u00a0<em>In Moonfall</em>, the moon may be a megastructure which, Emmerich explains, \"<em>Some people believe that megastructures are a built shell around a star</em>.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/moonfall-images.jpg\" /></figure><p>Obviously, Emmerich steps away from the real-world basis of his inspiration because the moon in\u00a0<em>Moonfall</em> is not a megastructure that contains a star. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/moonfall-movie-trailer-patrick-wilson-halle-berry-video/\"><em>Moonfall</em>'s\u00a0fake moon</a> contains something much more sinister. The danger inside the moon seems to be sentient and hostile to Fowler and her team, and presumably, its origin is a mystery\u00a0<em>Moonfall</em>'s<em>\u00a0</em>heroes will have to uncover throughout the film.</p><p>Since he made a name for himself with his blockbuster hits, Roland Emmerich has faced criticism for relying on large-scale visual effects too heavily. Others have also complained about the scientific inaccuracies his films contain, and while it seems true that\u00a0<strong><em>Moonfall</em></strong> seems to lean closer to the fiction side of science-fiction rather than the science side, Emmerich's source inspiration shows how he can take something rooted in math and physics and turn it into something fantastic.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/moonfall-independence-day-2-ending-setup-alien-fight/\">Moonfall Is Delivering Independence Day 2's Silliest Ending Set-Up</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/roland-emmerich-moonfall-trailer/?utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_entertainmentweekly&amp;utm_content=new&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_term=61d71336df9b5d0001e3765e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EW</a></p>"}], "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 23:01:10 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 6, 23, 1, 10, 3, 6, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/moonfall-movie-fake-moon-origins-director-explained/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "10 Best Video Game Sidekicks | ScreenRant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "10 Best Video Game Sidekicks | ScreenRant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/best-video-game-sidekicks/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/best-video-game-sidekicks/", "authors": [{"name": "Jago Hepburn"}], "author": "Jago Hepburn", "author_detail": {"name": "Jago Hepburn"}, "tags": [{"term": "Lists", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "img": {"src": "https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Best-Xbox-One-Hidden-Gems-Firewatch.jpg"}, "figure": "", "list-items": "", "summary": "Sidekicks are more than just an extra fist in a fight, and it&#039;s clear the ones here had a profound effect on each of the protagonists they stood by.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Sidekicks are more than just an extra fist in a fight, and it&#039;s clear the ones here had a profound effect on each of the protagonists they stood by."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<p>While sidekicks in comics tend to suffer bad fates like Jason Todd or\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/bucky-barnes-jaime-lannister-better-anti-hero-mcu-game-of-thrones/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">better-known\u00a0anti-hero\u00a0Bucky Barnes</a>, video game sidekicks tend to be a lot better regarded.

In \"Terms of Employment,\" Grace attempted to sue a client and asked Will to represent the case for her. However, Will ended up accepting a job offer from the client instead, leaving Grace feeling betrayed.</p><p>As she tried to represent herself in the case, Will tried to reconcile with her, calling her \"Gracie.\" The scene itself was funny, as Grace failed in her attempts to defend herself, but this quote was a highlight.

The quote was the perfect example of Grace's unique and witty take on the world, with the reference to the political party a funny and even accurate one.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Karen-and-Grace-2-Will-and-Grace-Cropped.jpg\" /></figure><p>Whilst <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/will-grace-karen-walker-best-funniest-quotes/\">Karen had some excellent one-liners</a>, Grace did too, especially when they were aimed at her assistant. Whenever Karen deigned to turn up to her and Grace's place of work, more often than not, she caused more problems than she solved, which in this case, led to Grace hilariously calling Karen out.</p><p>Karen's relaxed approach to her job was something that Grace was somewhat used to, but that didn't stop her from speaking her mind from time to time, and the results were always hilarious.

After Jack had been persistently annoying her in the episode \"Ben? Her?\" Grace fired back with this retort.</p><p>Jack always had a way of getting himself involved with other people's business, but in this instance, Grace was having none of it. Her line was the perfect blend of a jokey threat and an actual warning for Jack not to mess with her, and it was a great comeback.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Eric-McCormack-on-Will-Grace.png\" /></figure><p>Joe and Larry's wedding in the episode \"Coffee and Commitment,\" showed Will and Grace butting heads again. Will tried to separate himself from Grace in fear that the two were becoming more and more like a married couple every day, and Grace was confused as to why Will would even think that of their relationship.</p><p>When Will finally confronted Grace as to why he was being distant, Grace said this hilarious line. Not only did she effortlessly diffuse the argument, but she also made a great point.

Released in 2009 for the Nintendo DS and PSP,\u00a0<em>Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron</em>\u00a0was the fifth\u00a0installment of the\u00a0<em>Battlefront</em> series. Some fans might not have heard of this before, because the handheld-only game felt more\u00a0like a <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-wars-battlefront-spinoff-ea-cancelled-2019/\"><em>Star Wars</em>\u00a0<em>Battlefront</em> spin-off</a> game rather than a proper entry into the series.\u00a0<em>Elite Squadron</em> deviated from the faction-based campaigns of Pandemic's first two\u00a0<em>Battlefront\u00a0</em>games\u00a0and instead focused solely on the character X2, a force-sensitive clone whose DNA was sequenced from a Jedi and not Jango Fett.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/elite-squadron-gameplay.jpg\" /></figure><p><em>Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron</em>'s story had a strange protagonist and went all over the place in a very weird narrative departure for the series. The game begins with X2 and his brother X1, both force-sensitive clones, training other clones ahead of the Clone Wars. Later, in the battle of Cato Neimodia, Order 66 is executed and X2 kills Jedi Master Ferroda, but feels regret. After Order 66, X1 joins the Empire but X2 goes rogue and is hunted down.\u00a0X2 then trains in secret, is quickly found by the Empire, and is forced into hiding again. He is discovered by the Rebel Alliance shortly afterward and\u00a0decides to join them. After a failed duel with X1, who has turned to the dark side,\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-wars-luke-skywalker-best-version-battlefront-lego/\">Luke Skywalker appears in the\u00a0game</a>\u00a0and gives X2 a lightsaber, before training him for an inevitable fight with X1.</p><p><em>Elite Squadron</em>'s story of a Force-sensitive clone may seem interesting, but in practice, it didn't make much sense. If the Kaminoans had access to Force-sensitive DNA, and both X1 and X2 were so effective as soldiers,\u00a0it would've made more sense to base their army on a Jedi and not Jango Fett. X2's involvement in the Galactic Civil War also feels incredibly bolted-on and somewhat jarring.\u00a0He receives regular training and advice from Luke Skywalker, who at that point should be the Rebellion's only hope as its one remaining Jedi. If Luke had discovered another Force-sensitive during his days with the Rebels, then\u00a0it wouldn't make sense for him to not bring\u00a0it up to Yoda or Obi-Wan. Also, the two central characters are referred to as X1 and X2, which aren't exactly the most compelling designations going.</p><p>The <em>Star Wars:\u00a0</em><em>Battlefront</em> series has produced some of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/best-star-wars-games-all-time/\">best <em>Star Wars</em> games</a> out there, but\u00a0<em>Elite Squadron</em> is definitely not one of them. The game deviated from the successful gameplay of the previous titles, and the story is so weird and ill-thought-out that anyone who didn't have a PSP or DS shouldn't feel like they missed out.

Would Daenerys Targaryen take what she believed to be rightfully hers? Would Jon Snow claim it, despite not wanting it? Could it be a left-field contender, like Gendry?</p><p>In the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-ending-explained/\">end, <em>Game of Thrones</em>' series finale</a> gave one of the most surprising answers, with Bran Stark taking the (no-longer-Iron) Throne and becoming Westeros' new King. The process to get to that point was a so-called Great Council, an assembling of the major Lords and Ladies of Westeros to vote on the new ruler. In <em>Game of Thrones</em> season 8, it was a chance to see some familiar, long-missing faces, although the actual mechanics of what happened left something to be desired.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/house-dragon-game-thrones-daenerys-targaryen-mad-queen-explain/\">House Of The Dragon Can Properly Explain Game Of Thrones' Daenerys Twist</a></span></p><p>In part because so many characters had died, but also for the ease of making the scene work, the Great Council that elected Bran as King in <em>Game of Thrones</em> season 8 wasn't so great after all, with fewer than 20 Lords and Ladies in attendance to pass the judgment. For such a momentous decision, it was somewhat underwhelming, especially given previous precedent\u00a0for Great Councils in <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-books-song-ice-fire-ending-grrm-controversy/\">George R.R. Martin's <em>A Song of Ice &amp; Fire</em></a> history, which is something <em>House of the Dragon</em> can show on screen.\u00a0While its main story doesn't include a Great Council - though one is mooted during the Dance of the Dragons, the Civil War that will at the core of the show - it could use flashbacks to Viserys I Targaryen becoming King, which was via a\u00a0Great Council that lived up to its name.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Great-Council-Game-of-Thrones-Season-8.jpg\" /></figure><p>After the death of King Jaehaerys I's heir, great Lords from across Westeros were called to discuss the succession of the throne and who should ultimately replace Jaehaerys. Held at Harrenhal, and in stark contrast to the one seen in\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-hbo-season-8-bad-reason/\"><em>Game of Thrones</em> season 8</a>, around a thousand lords attended, some staking out a place for months, with the actual deliberations lasting weeks as numerous contenders for the crown were deliberated. It was a momentous occasion that truly saw a gathering of everyone important (and not important) in Westeros, that showed just how the system could work, as well as highlighting its flaws. It's the kind of scene that helps to highlight of politics of Westeros, its laws of succession, and issues within those, which, done right, could be fascinating on screen.</p><p>The Great Council took place in 101 AC, which is well before the main story of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/house-dragon-game-thrones-prequel-timeline-takes-place-when/\"><em>House of the Dragon</em> takes place</a>. However, the moment is a defining one for the events of the Dance of the Dragons - not only does it put Viserys on the Iron Throne, but it establishes pacts, rivalries, and bitter feelings that will play out in the show. <em>House of the Dragon</em> is seemingly\u00a0incorporating multiple timelines, with younger versions of characters being cast alongside older ones, so a flashback, perhaps early on, to 101 AC\u00a0aren't out of the question.</p><p>Similarly, after the Dance of the Dragons, another Great Council of sorts is held in 136 AC, this time to decide the regents before Aegon III came of age and assumed power. Again, it was a huge gathering of Westerosi Lords, which could further show what a Great Council really looks like. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-finale-king-election-every-character/\"><em><strong>Game of Thrones</strong></em>' Great Council</a> choice was understandable, although there would've been many Lords and Ladies still in Westeros at the time who could have attended even in the background; it made the scene feel lesser and Westeros feel smaller, which in turn didn't help the new method of choosing a ruler land as well, which <em><strong>House of the Dragon</strong></em> can do the opposite of.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/house-dragon-game-thrones-targaryen-cast-characters-explained/\">House Of The Dragon Cast: Every Game of Thrones Prequel Character Explained</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 23:00:45 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 6, 23, 0, 45, 3, 6, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/house-dragon-game-thrones-prequel-king-bran-great-council/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Elektra's Cyborg Redesign Absolutely Destroyed Her Heroic Legacy", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Elektra's Cyborg Redesign Absolutely Destroyed Her Heroic Legacy"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/elektra-daredevil-redesign-cyborg-comics/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/elektra-daredevil-redesign-cyborg-comics/", "authors": [{"name": "Shaun Corley"}], "author": "Shaun Corley", "author_detail": {"name": "Shaun Corley"}, "tags": [{"term": "Comics News", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "In 2002&#039;s Marvel Knights: Millennial Visions, Ryan Bodenheim imagines a dark legacy for Elektra, turning her into a cybernetic assassin.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "In 2002&#039;s Marvel Knights: Millennial Visions, Ryan Bodenheim imagines a dark legacy for Elektra, turning her into a cybernetic assassin."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Elektra-legacy-hero-millennial-visions.png\" /></figure><p>When it comes to Marvel's legacy heroes - those like Spider-Man who pass on their names to the next generation - few fans are likely to name\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/elektra/\">Elektra</a></strong>, but one comic actually revealed a world in which the assassin inspires a huge number of imitators. In <em>Marvel Knights: Millennial Visions' </em>\"Elektra: Death on Two Legs,\" Ryan Bodenehem reimagines a future where <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/daredevil-writer-chip-zdarsky-reddit-ama-elektra/\">Elektra has inspired an army</a> of cybernetic super-soldiers, made from the bodies of comatose or seriously ill teenage girls - and one has just gone rogue.</p><p>Since her first appearance in 1981\u2019s <em>Daredevil #168</em>, Elektra has become not only an integral part of the <em>Daredevil </em>mythos, but the Marvel Universe as well. One of the deadliest assassins on Earth, Elektra has recently taken up the mantle of Daredevil herself, filling in for Matt Murdoch while he was in prison. In 2002, Marvel released <em>Marvel Knights: Millennial Visions</em>, a special one-shot where top artists took classic Marvel Knights characters - Elektra among them - and reimagined them for the twenty-first\u00a0century. Among others, readers saw a vision where <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/moon-knight-daughter-jessica-spector-legacy-marvel-comics/\">Moon Knight\u2019s daughter</a> had taken up her father\u2019s mantle, and a world where Blade stalked a cybernetic Dracula. These visions of the future were simultaneously dark and bold, and perhaps none embodied this more than Elektra, who saw her name and legacy hijacked and changed into something truly horrible.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/marvel-comics-elektra-vampire-variant-cover-preview/\">Elektra Becomes a Vampire in Sneak Peak at Solo Series</a></span></p><p>In a one-page text piece narrated by Nick Fury, readers learn that Doctor Doom has been assassinated by <em>\"E4.\"</em>\u00a0Fury relates the events leading up to this moment. Years prior, a Greek industrialist created an <em>\"Elektra-class Ninjabot,\"</em>\u00a0for use in covert missions. In a truly horrific twist, these Ninjabots were cyborgs, created by fusing bio-tech computers to comatose and seriously injured or ill teenage girls. First-generation models had proven <em>\"pretty buggy\"</em>\u00a0(in Fury\u2019s words) but subsequent generations have improved, culminating in E4. Unlike previous models, E4 is self-aware - a former <em>\"antisocial Goth\"\u00a0</em>who attempted to take her own life at her school prom.\u00a0Nick Fury sends E4 to Latveria <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/kang-conqueror-doctor-doom-rival-timeless-enemy-villain/\">to kill Doctor Doom</a>\u00a0- a job E4 does with great relish, going rogue when the order is rescinded. As the piece ends, Fury concludes that future Elektra-class Ninjabots will have fail-safes, to prevent such an event from happening again.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Elektra-Millennial-Visions-Nick-Fury-Shield.png\" /></figure><p>The legacy created for Elektra here stands in contrast to the character\u2019s arc in the past few years, particularly in recent issues of <em>Daredevil</em>. When Elektra took up Daredevil\u2019s mission to protect Hell\u2019s Kitchen, a certain set of expectations came with it - namely that Elektra would work non-lethally. While taking on Matt Murdock's legacy has <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/new-daredevil-becomes-major-villain-marvel-dystopian-future/\">proved an adjustment for Elektra</a>, it may ultimately be what\u00a0redeems her in the eyes of many and allows her to become a true hero.</p><p>However, the Elektra presented in <em>Marvel Knights:\u00a0</em><em>Millennial Visions</em> will have no such chance. This variant\u2019s legacy is forever tainted, created in a revolting fashion. The early Ninajbots had no say in their fate as the bio-tech was forced on them, but E4, the most recent model, has embraced the role, creating what will most certainly be a messy international incident in the process. A killer who tried to make the world better,\u00a0<em>Marvel Knights: Millennial Visions\u00a0</em>imagines <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/daredevil-elektra-woman-without-fear-series-marvel-comics/\">Elektra's legacy as one of remorseless death</a> and chaos, with only E4 left to perhaps become something more. Hopefully,\u00a0<strong>Elektra</strong>'s adventures since will make this a Millennial Vision that never comes true.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/elektra-cosplay-classic-costume-marvel-comics/\">Marvel's Elektra's Classic Costume Gets Stunning Cosplay Recreation</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 23:00:39 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 6, 23, 0, 39, 3, 6, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/elektra-daredevil-redesign-cyborg-comics/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "The Office: 10 Outlandish Lies Dwight & Jim Told Each Other", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "The Office: 10 Outlandish Lies Dwight & Jim Told Each Other"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/the-office-dwight-jim-outlandish-lies/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/the-office-dwight-jim-outlandish-lies/", "authors": [{"name": "Lynn Gibbs"}], "author": "Lynn Gibbs", "author_detail": {"name": "Lynn Gibbs"}, "tags": [{"term": "Lists", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "Jim didn&#039;t take his job seriously on The Office, which led him to lie to Dwight for fun or to get back at him for reciprocal lies.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Jim didn&#039;t take his job seriously on The Office, which led him to lie to Dwight for fun or to get back at him for reciprocal lies."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<p>Jim and Dwight are known for pushing the truth with each other on\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-office/\"><em>The Office</em>.</a> After years of working beside each other, the only way the two could get through the workday sometimes was to prank each other or tell a white lie to get the other all riled up.

However, the real kicker was at the end of the episode. Dwight was seen questioning Mr. Franklin about his time period. After Mr. Franklin answered every question correctly, Dwight told the cameras, \"I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.\" This proves that Jim's lie was so convincing that Dwight believed that Ben Franklin was back from the dead.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Michael-reading-a-complaint-from-Jim-on-The-Office.jpg\" /></figure><p>When Michael worked on conflict resolution with the office, Dwight found out that all of his complaints against Jim were never sent to corporate like he was told.

Dwight agreed to do the interview but it was canceled shortly after. Instead of telling Dwight the interview was canceled, Jim, Pam, and Nellie decided to lie to Dwight.</p><p>They all pretended they were different people on the other end of the phone while Dwight praised Dunder Mifflin and his character. The fake call put Dwight in a tizzy, and instead of coming clean about\u00a0their lies, Jim let Dwight think what he wanted.

Michael and Dwight wanted to pull a prank on Karen at the Utica branch and needed Jim to get the job done. Lying to Jim was their only option.

Each special episode generally focused on a different, smaller group of main characters.</p><p>These standalone episodes resulted in every main character being absent from at least three episodes out of the 24 shown, including the titular character. These standalone episodes returned sporadically in later seasons but seem to be being gradually phased out.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Teddy-Altman-in-Greys-Anatomy.jpg\" /></figure><p>Teddy Altman first appeared in Season 6 as Seattle Grace's newest cardio surgeon, and best friend of Owen Hunt. Although she left a couple of seasons later, Teddy made a lasting impact and her interactions with Cristina produced some of series's best moments.</p><p>Teddy returned in Season 14 in a guest capacity, before being made a series regular again the following season. So far, Teddy is the only main character to receive 2 separate stints on the show. Other main characters have returned for guest appearances however.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Amelia-Richard-and-Bailey-in-Greys.jpg\" /></figure><p>Since, <em>Grey's</em> is so popular, it has spawned multiple spinoffs. The first spinoff, <em>Private Practice</em>, focused on Addison Montgomery, and Richard and Bailey both appeared in a guest capacity. Amelia also appeared on the show as a series regular for more than three seasons.</p><p>The next spinoff\u00a0is <em>Station 19</em> which features <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/greys-anatomy-imdb-best-crossover-episodes/\">frequent crossovers with <em>Grey's Anatomy</em>.</a> Richard, Bailey and Amelia have all starred as guests.

Generally though, they tend to stick around for more than a year. This was not the case with Erica Hahn.</p><p>Hahn was a polarizing character as she was unpleasant and treated Cristina Yang horribly.

Lois and Clark\u00a0discover a drilling project has allowed small, gnome-like creatures to come to the surface, and the fear and misunderstanding on the part of the townspeople they terrify means Superman has to intervene. It's an allegory designed to draw parallels to the Red Scare of the 1950s, but without any reference to the comic books source material, it's little more than a monster movie with a superhero.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/batman-the-movie-1966.jpg\" /></figure><p>As the iconic Dynamic Duo, Adam West and Burt Ward fought crime in Gotham City as <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/batman-1960s-best-worst-episodes/\">Batman and Robin for 120 episodes</a> over three seasons,\u00a0and this particular feature film was spawned by the massive success of the first.

While the\u00a0<em>Swamp Thing</em>\u00a0of 1982 often gets overlooked in discussions of DC Comics adaptations (and to be fair, there were a number of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/swamp-thing-best-dc-comic-issues-ever/\">great issues of Swamp Thing comics</a>), it did well enough on home video to spawn a sequel,\u00a0<em>The Return of Swamp Thing</em>, in 1989.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Incredible-Hulk-returns-fight-screenrant.jpg\" /></figure><p>While\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/hulk/\">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> ran for five seasons on CBS, it took\u00a0six years and a jump to NBC for the character \u2014 played with shaggy-haired aplomb by bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno \u2014 to make his return. Given the half-hearted attempt to introduce other Marvel\u00a0heroes\u00a0into the story,\u00a0<em>The Incredible Hulk Returns</em> ends up being more cringe-worthy than laudable.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/thor/\">Thor</a> turns up, he's not from Asgard; he's been banished from Valhalla, and he looks more like an overzealous fan at a Minnesota Vikings game than the God of Thunder comics fans know and love.

He is a smooth talker and a charming individual all-around and his physical strength was fueled by his willful determination.</p><p>Jayce had some faltering traits, such as his narrow-mindedness, often making him oblivious to things happening in the background. However, even with his naivete, he was one of the most determined individuals in the show, dead set on completing his goals. He worked his way up to a council member with his charm and intelligence and he claimed his own power and took charge of difficult situations over the people of Piltover. He also has pure physical strength with his toned body and electrified hammer invention, which he proves in his fight alongside Vi in the Shimmer dispensary.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Sevika</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arcane-Sevika.jpg\" /></figure><p>Sevika was a ruthless and dangerous warrior of the Undercity who could hold her own in any fight, even against Vi. Her Shimmer enhanced arm made her an even more deadly opponent.</p><p>Sevika was Silco's second-in-command and his muscle for many of their ventures. She often called the shots when it came to the henchman under Silco. Her brute strength and skill were obvious in her battles with Vi, putting up a good fight against her. The addition of her cybernetic Shimmer arm made her even more of a threat and one of the most powerful characters when it came to head-to-head battles.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Vander</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arcane-Vander.jpg\" /></figure><p>Vander was a great teacher and fatherly figure for Vi, Powder, Mylo, and Claggor and a figure anyone who needed help could seek out. He proved he was a well-rounded individual and a well-seasoned one, as well.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/league-legends-list-solo-queue/\">A League Of Legends Champions Tier List For Solo Queue</a></span></p><p>The show reveals how Vander was the leader of an uprising, proving he knew how to be a great leader and knew what needed to be done for the benefit of the Undercity. He also knew how to deal with the authorities and did his best to keep people out of trouble. He was a seasoned fighter, which shows in his fight against Deckard and Silco's men. His willpower is what ultimately makes him a powerful character and even when fans thought he was down for good, he kept coming back to protect the ones he loved.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Vi</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arcane-Vi.jpg\" /></figure><p>Vi was a fierce character constantly ready for a fight and didn't need anyone else to fight her battles. Vander was a great teacher for her and probably the reason for her hand-to-hand combat and athletics skills. Undoubtedly, she was one of\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/best-characters-in-league-of-legends-netflix-series-arcane-ranked/\">the best characters in <em>Arcane</em></a>\u00a0and one of the most powerful.</p><p>Fans right away can tell Vi is a fearless individual ready to do whatever it takes to get what she needs. In her first confrontation with Deckard and his goons, she shows just how well she can throw punches as she takes them all on almost entirely by herself. Her time in the prison only made her even more strong-willed and physically tough. She practiced in all her free time to constantly improve, which shows in her battles after that.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Jinx</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arcane-Jinx.jpg\" /></figure><p>Powder was constantly underestimated and treated like an incompetent child, which only fueled her when she became Jinx to prove them all wrong. Her rage is only a part of why she is the most powerful character in the series, so far. Even with her unpredictable behavior, she was a fan-favorite character\u00a0on both the\u00a0game and the series, leading to many fans creating some amazingly\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/league-of-legends-jinx-cosplay/\">accurate Jinx <em>League of Legends</em> cosplays</a>.</p><p>Jinx has pent-up anger and guilt eating away at her, making her feel like she had to become stronger and improve her inventions to get revenge or prove herself. Her incredible inventions and tinkering equipped her with deadly weapons, such as grenades and explosives. Her cold-hearted nerve makes her a dangerous opponent and she proved she was the most powerful character of the season with her last-minute lethal rocket launch straight toward the council building in Piltover.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/arcane-league-of-legends-similar-anime/\">10 Anime To Watch After Finishing Arcane League Of Legends\u00a0</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 23:00:19 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 6, 23, 0, 19, 3, 6, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/most-powerful-characters-league-legends-arcane-ranked/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Sing 2: The 10 Best Songs In The Movie | ScreenRant", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Sing 2: The 10 Best Songs In The Movie | ScreenRant"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/sing-2-movie-best-u2-songs/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/sing-2-movie-best-u2-songs/", "authors": [{"name": "Kyra Matus"}], "author": "Kyra Matus", "author_detail": {"name": "Kyra Matus"}, "tags": [{"term": "Lists", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "img": {"src": "https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ash-and-Calloway-sing-together-in-Sing-2.jpg"}, "figure": "", "list-items": "", "summary": "Sing 2 reimagines many songs and uses music to pump up its audience with popular and catchy tunes.

Though it's a pretty short scene, the\u00a0tempo of the melody compared to the rest of the film emphasizes its importance.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>\"Heads Will Roll\"</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ash-In-Sing-2-performs-Heads-will-Roll.jpg\" /></figure><p>\"Heads Will Roll\" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs is a great song for Ash, played by Scarlett Johansson, and it introduces her character in this film. Not only was this an unexpected song choice for a star like <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/scarlett-johansson-upcoming-movies-roles/\">Johansson, who just\u00a0released <em>Black Widow</em></a>,\u00a0but she absolutely rocked out in this song and made it her own.</p><p>This song also sets up the fact that Ash is kind of a big deal in the music world of <em>Sing 2</em> and it makes her out to be a rockstar. Overall, it defines her character and makes audiences excited to see what else she will cover in the rest of the movie.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>\"Where The Streets Have No Name\"</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Where-the-streets-have-no-name-performed-by-Moons-group.jpg\" /></figure><p>\"Where The Streets Have No Name\" is another U2 song that Moon's crew and Ash sing to audition for Mr. Crystal's stage show in the capital, where everyone can see them perform.</p><p>The harmonies with all the characters in this song are so beautiful and perfectly show off their talents.\u00a0Though things don't really work out as they had originally planned, this a cappella moment captures the different qualities and tones of each of these actors' voices in a unique way compared to the rest of <em>Sing 2</em>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>\"Say A Little Prayer For You\"</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Meena-preparing-to-sing-Say-A-Little-Prayer-For-You.jpg\" /></figure><p>\"Say A Little Prayer For You\" is an Aretha Franklin song that goes great with Meena's voice and also with the story in this particular moment. She is clearly overwhelmed before it starts and doesn't know if she can pull it off, but she does.</p><p>During the song, to help her make the performance believable, she imagines she's performing with her crush, Alfonso, rather than Darius, a self-absorbed performer she has to work with. This song gives her the courage to finally ask him out and it's dreamlike in its visual storytelling as she sings the song.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>\"Could Have Been Me\"</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rosita-leads-the-Sing-2-cast-to-their-performance.jpg\" /></figure><p>\"Could Have Been Me\" is sung by a new member of the group, Crystal's daughter, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/sing-2-trailer-best-tweets-memes/\">Porsha, who <em>Sing 2</em> fans on Twitter seem to love</a>. This Struts song was an interesting choice, but it does encapsulate this character who is a go-getter that wants to be a great performer, just like everyone else.</p><p>Although Porsha struggles with acting, her singing is outstanding, and this song's alien-like visual effects are really intricate and well designed to match the music at times. Halsey's voice is outstanding as she passionately belts out this song and it's one of the most unusual sets in the final extravaganza.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>\"Your Song Saved My Life\"</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bono-aka-Calloway-in-SIng-2.jpg\" /></figure><p>\"Your Song Saved My Life\" is the final song of the movie performed and written by U2 especially for <em>Sing 2</em>.

This is one of the most carefree songs in the movie because it comes before the main conflict starts and involves and introduces a lot of the members of the cast.</p><p>This song is vibrant and has some cute dancing and fun moments that show just how far Moon and his musical misfits have come since the ending of the last film. Johnny and Meena sing this song together and pump up the audience, getting them ready to listen to more of what these characters have to offer.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>\"Break Free\"</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rosita-and-Her-husband-perform-Break-free-in-SIng-2.jpg\" /></figure><p>Rosita's rendition of \"Break Free\" is full of drama and character development. Not only does <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/sing-2-cast-actors-other-movies-tv-shows/\">Reese Witherspoon, who is in many TV shows and films,</a> sing the song in a nuanced way\u00a0compared to Ariana Grande, but Rosita, the character, gets over her fear of heights during the performance. The costumes in this number are also spectacular.</p><p>When Rosita sees Moon falling after being pushed off a ledge, even though she was hesitating to jump for her show, she instantly goes to help her friend in trouble. When she saves Moon, she puts her love of her friend over her fear. She also does this all while singing this extreme soprano song, impressively.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>\"Sky Full Of Stars\"</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sky-full-of-stars-performed-by-Taron-Egerton.jpg\" /></figure><p>\"Sky Full of Stars,\" originally performed by Coldplay, is a great song for Johnny in his final performance of the film. Not only does the actor, Taron Egerton, know how to sing with the piano, but when the song breaks out into a stage-wide dance set, it becomes even more interesting.</p><p>Though the song is intercut with other drama happening in the movie\u00a0around Moon and Calloway, Johnny's singing and dancing are some of the highlights of the film. Because Johnny had such a big story arc in <em>Sing</em>, it's also easier to root for his character here, as he has gone through a lot of hardship.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>\"Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\"</h2><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ash-and-Calloway-sing-together-in-Sing-2.jpg\" /></figure><p>This U2 song sung by Ash and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/sing-2-teaser-poster-cast-halsey-bono-pharrell/\">Clay Calloway, played by Bono, as shown in the <em>Sing 2</em> trailer</a>, is easily the best of the film. Not only is it a soulful melody that fans of all ages should know, but it comes at the emotional climax of the movie when Clay finally decides to step out on stage and perform for the first time in a long time.</p><p>This moment restores everyone's faith in music and its ability to heal. Not to mention, Johansson and Bono's voices perfectly suit each other in this duet version of this famous song. It's a ballad, of sorts, that carries emotional weight but still remains faster-paced, making it the best choice for this scene.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/sing-2-similar-movies/\">The 10 Best Movies Like Sing 2</a></span></p>"}], "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 23:00:17 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 1, 6, 23, 0, 17, 3, 6, 0], "id": "https://screenrant.com/sing-2-movie-best-u2-songs/", "guidislink": false}, {"title": "Glee: The Best Episode Of Each Season, According To IMDb", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "Glee: The Best Episode Of Each Season, According To IMDb"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://screenrant.com/glee-best-episodes-each-season-imdb-ratings/"}], "link": "https://screenrant.com/glee-best-episodes-each-season-imdb-ratings/", "authors": [{"name": "Lucy-Jo Finnighan"}], "author": "Lucy-Jo Finnighan", "author_detail": {"name": "Lucy-Jo Finnighan"}, "tags": [{"term": "Lists", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "summary": "The website IMDb has been able to decide which episodes of Glee are the best ones from each season, and it&#039;s hard to disagree.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "The website IMDb has been able to decide which episodes of Glee are the best ones from each season, and it&#039;s hard to disagree."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://screenrant.com/feed/", "value": "<p><em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/glee/\">Glee</a>\u00a0</em>was a polarizing show through all of its six seasons.

The stakes are high as the main characters face their toughest competition yet: Vocal Adrenaline, who had been built up throughout the season.</p><p>While the New Directions don't advance past regionals, their performance is still amazing, and the fact that it includes the show's most iconic number (Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\") makes the episode itself iconic. The episode also has another of the best, if most bewildering, performances, as Vocal Adrenaline perform Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" while dancing symbolically as Quinn simultaneously gives birth.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Glee-Original-Song-S2E16.jpg\" /></figure><p>This episode pushed <em>Glee</em> to a new level, as\u00a0this was the first time the show made its own original music. While <em>Glee</em> is mostly known for its amazing covers, hearing \"Loser Like Me\" is a showstopping experience, and the joy that the characters exude while singing it is infectious. The whole episode is filled with joy, as the New Directions\u00a0 make it past regionals and are now headed to nationals.</p><p>And while the New Direction's original song was great, the other teams all performed to fun tunes as well. It's always great to see Kurt and Blaine sing together.

Due to the stress of college, cheating, and just life in general, four couples break up, and it's heart-breaking to watch. The episode culminates in a group number of Coldplay's \"The Scientist,\" where the best moments of each couple are highlighted. It brings back beloved\u00a0clips of previous episodes, which would usually be great to see, but they make the number all the more emotionally painful to watch.</p><p>Another highlight of the episode is Santana's rendition of Taylor Swift's \"Mine,\" which is much smaller in production, but just as heartbreaking, and it's a very intimate moment between arguably the most loved couple on the show.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Quarterback-Glee.jpg\" /></figure><p>This is arguably the best known and highest-rated episode of the entire show.

Overall, the cast and crew put their all into this episode to honor a truly great character and actor, and they do so spectacularly.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Glee-Dreams-Come-True-S6E13.jpg\" /></figure><p><em>Glee</em>'s series finale episode sticks the landing.\u00a0It brings back pretty much every recurring character from all six seasons, and while some of the episode's plot resolutions are wacky, this feels perfectly in line with <em>Glee</em>.</p><p>Getting to see where such beloved characters end up is lovely to watch, and of course, the final performance of One Republic's \"I Lived\" brings everyone together for a truly spectacular closing number.

Thirty years ago this year saw the start of the iconic <em>The\u00a0Death of Superman</em> storyline which saw the Earth's champion being the only one to stop the seemingly indestructible Doomsday but only at the cost of his own life.</p><p>However, with the nature of comic books, the <em>Return of Superman</em> saw Clark Kent rise from the grave and return to his duty as a hero once more. Many have seen the events of this story play out in films like <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/batman-v-superman/\"><em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em></a> and <em>Superman: Doomsday</em>, but this hardcover will surely be a sought after item for those finally wanting to dive into the original series\u00a0that inspired plots in their favorite DCEU and DCAU properties.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Batman-Killing-Time-DC-Comics.jpg\" /></figure><p>Tom King, the writer of the acclaimed <em>The Sheriff of Babylon</em>\u00a0series, and comic book artist David Marquez join forces to create this all-new Batman story.

The actress plays Amanda on the hit Netflix series,\u00a0which is a spin-off of the popular '80s film franchise, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-karate-kid/\"><em>The Karate Kid</em></a>. The original film follows a lonely teen, Danny LaRusso (Ralph Macchio), as he struggles to navigate a new school. He is taken under the wing of Mr. Miyagi to learn the art of karate and finds his way to becoming a karate champion. <em>Cobra Kai</em> takes place in the modern-day and follows Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), Danny\u2019s childhood rival, and Danny, with <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cobra-kai-daniel-miyagi-do-wrong-reasons-lessons/\">Ralph Macchio reprising his role</a>, as they train a new generation of karate teens under the dojos of Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do.</p><p>Henggeler plays Amanda LaRusso, Danny\u2019s wife, who finds herself further mixed into the conflict between karate dojos and the teens. While earlier seasons keep Amanda outside of the fight,\u00a0season 4 sees her more involved. After\u00a0a massive break-in at the end of <em>Cobra Kai\u00a0</em>season 3, Amanda must do what she can to save her daughter from the same fate as Miguel, who is attacked and hospitalized\u00a0after a fight at school.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cobra-kai-strike-first-meaning-change-season-4/\">Cobra Kai Redefines What \"Strike First\" Means</a></span></p><p>In an interview with <em>THR</em>, Henggeler reveals that she wants Amanda to do karate in <em>Cobra Kai</em>\u00a0season 5. The actress reveals that she is incredibly proud of the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/cobra-kai-season-4-viewership-hours-netflix-details/\">massive success\u00a0<em>Cobra Kai</em> has had</a> in its run and her involvement as the LaRusso matriarch. Each season, she asks the writers for a karate scene with her character, but they have yet to budge. Henggeler would not be opposed if the story calls for her to break out her karate moves someday. Read what she said below:</p><blockquote><p>I really hope that someday we see Amanda\u2019s confidence in her own karate abilities. One of these seasons, she has to know some karate, right?! (<em>Laughs</em>.) I have suggested to the writers that she finally does karate, and they\u2019re like, \u201cHmm. <em>Maybe</em> someday\u2026\u201d Perhaps when they have no storylines left.

But I lay the groundwork every season!</p></blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cobra-Kai-Daniel-Amanda-LaRusso.jpg\" /></figure><p>Amanda\u2019s life would have changed the day she met Danny LaRusso. With Danny\u2019s involvement in karate and teaching their daughter, Amanda at some point would have had to have learned a move or two. But with\u00a0Danny LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence truly teaming up\u00a0next season, Amanda\u2019s odds for her own karate match are dwindling. However, a hint of what she may hold within would treat fans of the series\u00a0with\u00a0its empowerment of female characters.</p><p>Next season will see John Kreese (Martin Kove), Cobra Kai founder, facing legal battles while Johnny and Danny must face off with new <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/terry-silver-cobra-kai-karate-kid-3-story/\">Cobra Kai leader, Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith)</a>.

The SUV is built upon the strides the gaming and electronics company found with their Vision-S electric car prototype two years ago. Now, a new company \u2014 Sony Mobility, Inc. \u2014 has been announced to extend its advancements in the tech space to the transportation industry. The company will be officially formed in the Spring of 2022 and signifies Sony's entrance into the commercial EV market.</p><p>After traditional car manufacturers started seriously working on electric vehicles, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/ford-hands-free-driving-ai-mustang-mach-e/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">like Ford's electric Mustangs,\u00a0</a>traditional electronics companies have dabbled with applying their technologies to electric vehicles. Sony showcased\u00a0its first working prototype at the 2020 CES with the Vision-S sedan. With the Vision-S, Sony focused on its strengths as a company. The electric car featured a new entertainment experience for travel, with innovative speakers and displays that provide a quality entertainment experience for each passenger. Since the reveal, Sony has spent over a year road testing the Vision-S electric car on the streets of Europe and began 5G road tests last April.</p><p>Related: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/nypd-electric-vehicles-mustang-mach-e/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The NYPD Just Bought Almost 200 Electric Mustangs \u2014 Here's Why</a></p><p>As competing mobile electronics brands like <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/smartphone-company-oppo-make-ev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xiaomi and OPPO plan electric vehicles,</a>\u00a0Sony's commercial launch plan of the Vision-S prototypes is an indicator of\u00a0its vision for the future of electric cars. \"We are exploring a commercial launch of Sony's EV,\" the company's CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said in the CES keynote. Sony Mobility Inc., encompasses more than just electric cars, though. In a release, the company stated its mission as to \"help realize a world where everyone can live in harmony with robots on a daily basis.\" In the mobility space, that includes the development of artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles, and drones.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tesla-model-3-gray-left.jpg\" /></figure><p>At the event, Sony upscaled\u00a0its tech inside the first Vision-S prototype to a new form factor: an SUV. The new electric vehicle, called Vision-S 02, will include seven seats to cater to family lifestyles. Since the SUV will have a larger footprint, Sony plans to make the most of that space with a captivating entertainment experience inside. The company says each individual seat will have its own speaker, which creates a three-dimensional, 360-degree sound field around the passenger. It will incorporate <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/sony-bravia-cam-tv-attachment-gestures-video-chats/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sony's Bravia Core tech</a> to provide a digital video system that gives users the options to watch videos together or pick their own content while traveling.</p><p>The vehicle includes unique customizability features best suited for the family audience of an SUV. The new Vision-S prototype includes a profile system so that each driver can create the driving displays the precise way they prefer. Drivers can even customize the acceleration and deceleration sounds of the electric car to mimic the traditional combustion engines that they may be familiar with. These features are synced with the cloud and mobile devices using 5G technologies.</p><p>Sony Mobility Inc is Sony's commitment to an electric world, from the areas of traditional cars, entertainment robots, and drones. The company's plans are to \"continue to apply its cutting-edge technologies to provide new experiences in the realm of mobility, which is undergoing a shift to electric vehicles (EV).\" They'll use their advancements in consumer electronics and artificial intelligence \u2014 like the newly announced <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/psvr-2-production-begins-soon-goertek-report/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PS VR 2 entering production</a>\u00a0\u2014 to create a car that prioritizes safety and user experience.
